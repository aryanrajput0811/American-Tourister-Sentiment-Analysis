"Top quality luggage. Excellent luggage, good choice of zipped internal compartments for smaller items. Very good wheels with great maneuverability."
American Tourister Bon Air Suitcase. Love this suitcase! It's very lightweight and manoeuvrable. The lock works very  well and changing the code is simple. Already recommended to family and friends and would certainly buy again.
"Perfect case. The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
 I have read many reviews and they all up and down.I bought this for a recent trip to Washington DC and had no issue. Packed for a week which was hard as I am a X-LARGE but 6 shirts, boxes and 3 hoodies.It is very light, vibrant colour and the wheels are awesome. Decent bearings. Before going I read reviews about the pull handle and I looked at loads in person, cases from £60 to £400 and they all the same in that aspect. If you mistreat them they will break but if you look after it no problem. No brainier.In my opinion a good buy and if it lasts me 4 or 5 international trips I would just buy another. Wear and tear is a given. If you buy a car and hit ever pot hole you are going to need new tire’s it goes with out saying the wheels on the case are the same."
"Its not as good as other American Tourister. I would not recomend this hand luggage, it is very expensive for the cheap plastic it is made of, the handle does not work properly we had to grease it to make it work, the zipper broke after 1 use, it is light I guess it deserves some praise for that? I tot;y regret the money spent"
Not durable at all...cheap bendable plastic..my sisters broke on first use.. When the delivery came I thought it will be a strong plastic but after inspection I was not happy and my sister was very upset hers broke the first time on her trip....I spent extra £13.35 to send it Back through post office. I am so upset as I'm a single mother and buying this suitcase has been a nightmare because its not easy sending it Back and it'll cost you alot to send Back aswel.I've been also told I will be getting charged for tax on the purchase so I will only get back £87.46 because they will charge me £17.49 on tax. So in purchasing this suitcase I have lost £30.34...I am a single mother struggling  to make ends meet.
"Nice suitcase. This is a good suitcase, and has lots of storage. The colour looks a bit different from the picture, but mainly is the same. I didn’t like how easily the suitcase got scratched."
"Junk, broke the first time it was used.. Product broke the first time we used it. Very poor quality and not suitable for air travel. Avoid and don't waste your hard earned money."
"Great suitcase an Great customer service. I love the suitcase, I bought the wrong size initially as its a large item the usual amazon evri return did not work 'evri' refused to take it.  The seller was really helpful, got it sorted for me very quickly.  I bought the bright yellow so it will stand out amongst the other suitcases."
Sturdy but leightweight. I ordered a large and cabin bag and have travelled four times with them now. Great lightweight bags that are pretty robust. The matching backpacks are good too!
Faulty!!. Faulty!!
A++++. Pefrect
Prompt delivery. Robust suitcase. Easy to manoeuvre and looks good.. Robust but Lightweight suitcase ideal size for my long haul trip. Chose Midnight blue. All good.
After one weekend…. It’s seems quite sturdy. Don’t use on pavements tabs you’ll probably be fine
The zip is filmsy. Body is sturdy. The suitcase has been used only once. Loved the size. Perfect for a 4 days getaway However the zip is filmsy and won't think to fly with this suitcase. Good for local travels
This suitcase is rubbish. Zip is extremely poor quality. I regret buying this suitcase. It is extremely poor quality made for the price. The zip is poor quality and  I had to put a strap around the suitcase to make sure it doesn’t open! Waste of money. Sadly I can’t return it and get a refund.
Zip issues. Zip is horrible. Spend your money on a trash bag. Even better.
"light for it's size. just used the case for the first time and the lock failed to open so I had to take a taxi to a luggage store to open it in the end they had to force the lock I am now waiting for a response from American touritster, response not good I apparently have to pay out of my own pocket to return the case so they can inspect the broken lock also Amazon will not accept a return on this case, decided to scrap the case too much hassle dealing with this company."
Ideal replacement for travel. Lovely to look at and replaces my old one perfectly
Light and sturdy. Very happy with the quality and the sturdiness. The suitcase survived some very rough handling during my travels in the States. The lock feature is good and the suitcase is very easy to maneuver.Recommended
Zip doesn’t extend all the way to the back!!!. Zip doesn’t open all the way back on one side but can’t send back due to travel. Very dissatisfied
Very pleased with the cases. Lovely cases & very easy to move along when travelling
"Stitching ripped within hours of opening it. Arrived today. Began packing and went to zip up the inside liner. It ripped, despite not being overpacked in the slightest. Traveling tomorrow so have to use it, but will be making use of the warranty."
"Broke after first use. This suitcase broke the first time I undid the case. Its a shame because it's very manoeuvrable and nice looking. It meant the case needed to be duct taped home when I came back. It was quite stressful as I wasn't sure it would hold. One thing to note is that after only one flight the case was scuffed, probably more to do with the baggage handling though"
"Zip quality isn't reliable. After 1 flight, the zip on the case had come open and progressively gotten worse over time. I fly 3 times a month taking this with me each time, and each time the zip has been more and opened/damaged.I really expected better quality for the price. If anyone can recommend a solid, reliable brand please do share."
"Cabin size suitcase.. Bought two of these for my daughter and her boyfriend travelling to Dubai, Australia and Vietnam plus islands, for 3 mths. I’m delighted to say they survived all of their travels without any problems. Look great and non the worse for ware too. Would definitely recommend."
All good. All good brilliant value
Broken after one use.. Used once and zips on inside are already ripped and frayed.
"Sturdy and manoeuvres easy. Case is sturdy enough to be chucked around if you are taking on a plane, size is good enough for a weekend away but would need large size for week or more"
"Not impressed. Purchased two suitcases in June. One for me ,one for my partnerFirst outing with them today and the zip on the internal compartment of my partner's suitcase ""  broke,""The zip did not go all the way round and the teeth came apart. Shoddy for what is supposed to be a quality item and not a cheap item.Does not look good for future use.Where do. I complain?"
Good product for money. It’s all good in every way
"Probably the worst suitcase I ever bought. The sliders of the suitcase broke even before the first use. I had to fix it before to use it since I wasn't able to sent it back in time (I needed to use it 3 days later). For this price it's a joke. The one I have bought in Primark for half of the price was better and definitely less breakable. I don't recommend it, save your money instead of buying this suitcase."
"Amazing suitcase, very easy to move around and lots of space. Durable, lightweight and looks cool.. Everything feels well made with this case, it's of a really good quality. Considering the price is more at the reasonable end of the market.The case seems to take a beating too, I took this on a 23 hour journey to Hawaii and back - with 3 connections. I know it would probably withstand another few trips some day.It's very spacious inside, the compartments are also made in a way that makes it really easy to store all your requirements. The only reason I deducted 1 star, was for the locking mechanism, because it's sometimes a bit fiddly to get the two zips aligned back in to the lock when closing and locking the case. There's a knack for it, which most will figure out, but sometimes in a hurry it can be a little annoying.It's very lightweight for how tough it feels, so the materials used must be perfect. When it's really full and packed - the wheels are the star of the show! I suffer from a medical condition that gives me weak arms and legs, I fatigue out faster than other people and become very tired. This makes 23 hours of travelling hard on it's own, but the case at least took some of that effort out. I felt confident the case was solid the whole way too. I did see some bumps and scratching at the end of the journey, but the case is going through 3 airports, so that's to be expected. This case shrugs all that stuff off.This was easy to move through every airport and the wheels glide smoothly with no noise, handle is really solid and easy to extend/stow too.:)"
"American tourister suitcase. Do not buy, we bought ours in August for our October holiday. So only used once, Handle will not retract and zip spilt open and no one wants to take responsibility for it. Costs £116 so not cheap!!!!"
"Love this!. Really like this suitcase. Stylish, easy to move around and elegant. Packs quite a lot in it too."
Internal zip broke after one trip. Outside 30 day returns window <U+0001F621>. So frustrating that I now have to seek a manufacturer’s refund rather than direct from Amazon.
Great customer service. I did have a slight issue with the lock but the seller resolved the issue quickly for me.
After 1 (ONE) journey. 
Disappointed. Zip split after using it 3 times. Incredible that the quality is so bad
"Worst bag I’ve ever bought. Bought it, and it came broken, but even if it didn’t, I would have wanted to return it as the zip is so fragile and made of weak material."
"Ordered twice and returned it twice. Horrible quality, glue marks, uneven stitches, faulty zipper. I have a big American Tourister suitcase and the quality isn't anything like this."
"Excellent suitcase. I love it, it’s not heavy!!"
"Great luggage for business trips. Great quality of this suitcase.  Very elegant and professional style, shock resistant and above all very light.I have tried various small suitcases, but this one seems to have the right ergonomics and internal compartments with enough space for short and medium trips.  I use it for business trips and weekend getaways.The only flaw is the locking system, very basic and too easy to reset."
Cant complain. No problems at all after several long flights to and from USA
"Not up to the job. I have just come back from my first holiday with this case, it is wrecked! Scratched, dented and gouges take out of the case surface.When it was delivered I was happy with it, but now I wish I had never seen it, cost quite a bit and certainly isn’t destined for a long life as my cheaper previous case had.Do not be deceived by a pretty looking product!I certainly wouldn’t recommend it."
"TSA07 is locked and cannot be opened.. After second usage, the TSA07 locked is blocked and none of the numbers between 000 and 999 works, so I’ll have to break it to have it opened. I will have to break the whole piece after buying 4 months ago and using it for the second time. Unacceptable!!!"
Great Suitcase made by Samsonite. Looks good very light.
Bit costly but Best Build quality. Material is really grand and the color is exactly as shown in the picture and the stiching inside is A1 and it has few pockets inside as well. Handy enough
"Better service on returns. The second time used the Zip was broken when picking it of the airport karasell ,now finding it very difficult to return this case poor."
"No Side Handle - Really Annoying Miss. I really wouldn't recommend this bag. There is no side handle which is very annoying when placing the bag anywhere from in the boot, in overhead compartments or even when just putting back on top shelf storage in a wardrobe. Really big flaw in the design in my eyes and if I could go back in time to buy a case again I would find one with side handles. You would be amazed how much you use it. Otherwise the bag is fine, but the other features do not make up for that big miss."
"Instant broken wheel. I packed my bag, pulled it off the bed and as I pulled it along, a wheel broke. Literally 3 steps into use. Bad quality. Would not recommend."
"It’s classy. It’s a lightweight case for sure, but it’s strong and sturdy, so so far so good"
"Faulty zipper. The zipper finally popped on this after 1st use, which was very annoying and expensive!!"
Zip broke after first use. Zip broke after first trip and can’t find anywhere to repair it only had a month warranty when I bought it
Not worth the money!. Not great material! Only used ones and it’s already got dents and scratches!
Disappointed. The zip busted on this when we first used it
"Great suitcase. It's a great carry on. Perfect size, good quality. I am a cabin crew and I use it a lot and it is impeccable and easy to carry"
"Strong good looking large case.. Bought this large case for a holiday to Canada which included 5 flights. It performed excellently, despite a few scratches due to the obvious rough handling through the various airports. It's good looking with an enormous capacity, handy locking system and most importantly, has plenty of individual compartments for separate storage. Highly recommended."
beautiful. I love it
"Poor quality zip. Don't buy it. On the third journey, the zip broke. Lucky nothing fell out or was stolen when I picked it up from the luggage belt."
"Easy to move and very light.. Love the colour and nice and light ,plenty of room and easy to manoeuvre."
Lovely case. Really pleased to find American Tourister at excellent price on Amazon and with prime delivery. Really like also that it has good pockets inside.
"Very lightly. Quality. Professional looking. Quality, light material. Better using harness around  for airport baggage handling and tracks."
Broken zip. I bought this suitcase nearly 8 months ago. Everything is fine except a zip has broken. Understand its under 5 yr warranty .Can someone advise how do i claim warranty ?
Lock broke  on first trip. Just got back from holiday and can't open lock it's defective  was going tonuse my insurance  butbits drill covered  by warranty
Suits me!. Good quality make for a suitcase and has everything you need for a modern case.
"Nope !!  Second time /  larger suitcase. Very unfortunate , Second suitcase whilst away , zip opened with all contents showing very embarrassing. I don’t understand , it was only half of the required weight . Happened in the hotel when zipping … and then we re-zipped looked ok until it landed at Gatwick south terminal . Baggage reclaim … was every where very embarrassed  ."
"Don’t use the integrated lock. Bought their and packed it to go to Italy. Locked and opened the lock at least 10 times but when I tried to open it at the airport before boarding, the lock completely stopped responding to the code. You could tell the middle digit wasn’t having any effect when I tried to turn it. Had to get a hotel porter to break the lock off in order to get my clothes for holiday. Sent it back for a refund"
Excellent-fits a lot in for a cabin bag. Very light Easy to manoeuvre and perfect for a 4 day long weekend away
Decent purchase.. Bit pricey but quality is so far commendable. Which is expected given American Tourister is the Dior of Trolley bags. Would recommend
"Poor quality. Nice colour, lightweight but poor quality of bag frame"
"Let down by the lock. Good size and lightweight. However, the lock broke the second time we did up the case, meaning that we could not secure the contents properly for our whole holiday."
"Lightweight but can damage easily. Really lightweight suitcases - exactly what we were looking for. Even though they turned up well packaged in individual boxes 2 of the 4 we bought still had deformed fronts to them... they will still work fine, they just don't look great until full of stuff to oucsh them back into shape. Worth the money though and will hopefully last a good while."
"Lovely case shame poor stitching inside tore on first use. Trip to America, shame only able to use once"
"Don’t waste time comparing. This is an awesome case. I got it for our family summer holiday. It’s robust and works absolutely fine. It has a lovely interior and I’m very, very pleased  with it. It also doesn’t weigh a ton, I was reluctant after having a super light canvas case that eventually ripped. Sailed through gatwick airport with a nice smart looking bag!"
"Arrived damaged - difficult exchange. The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
 The product arrived with a broken zip, as you try to close it, it splits behind you. For the price, I didn't check for damages, so I only noticed 2 hours before leaving for the airport. Given that we didn't have another suitcase, we wrapped it in foil at the airport, and I am trying to get it exchanged, but I'm not in the country in the 30days I got. Amazon is making it very difficult to get my money back, and I am extremely disappointed with the product. Even if long term it may be a good suitcase, the fact that I can't rely on a £95 product to start with, says a lot about how unreliable it is. Amazon customer service in this situation is even worse!"
"Save your money and do not buy!. So i purchased this suitcase, going off the reviews and the actual make of this case i thought i would be getting a well made suitcase for my holidays, well iam very wrong. It arrived sunday put all my belongings in then went on holiday to find the zip had burst and half my clothes hanging out. I was mortified , ive bought cheap cases in the past and this has never happened. The hotel staff had to cellotape my case for the journey back. Dont buy its expensive and awful quality!"
Brilliant. Nice and light and very strong
Great value. Very lightweight for a hard shell and moves brilliantly on the castors.Lots of space for a good price.I find the very distinct 2 halves of the case less flexible for use than what I am used to (ie a big case with a top rather than 2 halves that come together).Plastic scratches quite easily.I would recommend though
"Great size, just an annoying lock. Size is great, way more space than I was expecting and the pockets inside are so useful for organising. The wheels are also pretty smooth, will have to see how they hold up though. It does feel heavier than I was expecting but I haven’t weighed it myself yet and my only downfall is the lock.. it’s a very strong lock which I admire…but.., the numbers have to be in such a specific place otherwise that very strong lock will keep you from getting to your stuff. I might buy a padlock instead but overall I really like this case :)"
"Good size suitcase. A very good size/lightweight/price suitcase. Been through 4 flight, and only few scratches."
Bright Yellow I can see it everytime. Great medium sized suitcase  easy toMove and the lock in is easy and no key to lose !
"Absolutely Useless. Packed new case for holiday (did not overload), picked suitcase up to weigh it (18 kg) and zip broke. Unable to find anyone to speak to about a refund. Bought in June but not used until last week. Cannot possibly recommend. Expensive mistake."
"Stylish. Easy to use. But feels a little flimsy.. - Like the style and space.- The lock is easy to use.- There are multiple neat compartments.- material lining the inside is smooth and feels good.- Has straps to secure items / clothings down too.- However, the shell feels a little thin, soft and easy to bend.- Used it on a trip recently on the road and a little rocky walkways. The wheels still work fine.- The pull along handle doesn't seem to be of quality and the locking feels as though it will give way easily.- The side handle works fine so far."
"Broken lift after 2 trips. The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 I like the outlook for this case. But its lift is way too easy to break and it can be a problem when you have to travel with lot of languages."
"Robust and good storage. This had enough space to match a previous more traditional style suitcase and is easier to move around.  Baggage handlers like the two handles.  Was advised to get a darker colour to minimise the appearance of inevitable scratches etc. Its a ""Which?"" recommended product so have high hopes of its longevity."
Zip went after a handful of trips so very disappointing. The product is really good but without a working zip it is obviously useless now
"Gave up, the first carousel it hit. The zip broke open on its first trip air-side.Nice to look at but if you’re thinking of putting stuff in it and taking on a plane, I wouldn’t."
"Broken on very first flight. Family holiday to Rhodes. First use and case appeared on the conveyor with 2 wheels smashed. Had another brand case for 6 years, multiple trips no issues..."
Very good. Very Good
"Poor quality?. Used this for one trip, case looks deformed when zipped up and inner zip separation sheet has torn. Considering the cost I'd expect it to last more than one week trip to Greece. Have requested full refund due to poor longevity and quality, which at time of writing I'm still to receive."
Light and sturdy looking !. Slight damage on delivery but sorted in very efficient way ! Not traveled yet but looks sturdy
Good all rounder. Good value suitcase
Damaged after second use. The item zipper broke after the second time going abroad - trying to return for a refund.
"Disappointed as it came late and couldn't use it. As the product came late, it  arrived when on the way to airport so disappointed about  the delivery, being a Prime member too .  Cannot comment on the product as it couldn't be used that is why 1 star was given but it looks good."
"Badly Damaged on Delivery. The product was badly damaged when it arrived, and it’s an ordeal to get my money refunded. Recommend not to buy. Ever !"
"Excellent case. Bought this case for a long weekend holiday, it’s really light weight and easy to manoeuvre. The separate compartments allowed me to split my clothes. Very impressed with the case especially for the price."
Light weight. Very light and easy to move around. Flexible material with good space. Down side: it scarathes easily.
"Lightweight, sturdy but awful TSA lock and easily scratched and scuffed. Lightweight, sturdy construction, good manoeuvrability when filled, convenient. Alas, the TSA lock is crap and came inoperable so I had to dismantle it and to my surprise it’s quality is appalling, it looks like it’s made of 30 year old metal, screws are worn and corroded, a disgrace to an otherwise good suitcase. I have the medium size too and it didn’t show this problem."
I love it. This time everything is fine thanks
"Chinese quality product.... The lock is practically a joke it definitely doesn't work!Apparently the rubber isn't as thick as it should be, but if you're extremely careful, the bag will probably last. some time"
"Worst cases ever. Zips just split open on first use, before we even got to airport. Only bought two cases, but both have the same fault. They want £15 each just to return them for a repair."
So light and also strong I’m very happy. Have recently needed a new suitcase as the one I had and have been laughing about was one I bought in an emergency in 2018 when in the usa as my case broke and needed one to pack my clothes to come home with. I have hated that case pretty much since I got it. I finally got round to ordering this American tourist case and so happy I did.The seller in particular was very impressive as it was packed perfectly with care. Have no qualms recommending this case and the seller
"Zip broke whilst on holiday. Suitcase not as strong as in picture. Zip broke whilst on holiday, suitcase is also not as strong as looks in picture"
Excellent quality product. This is a very light and robust suitcase. Highly recommended.
"Lock failed on the first trip. I bought this, mainly for the different colours, I bought a yellow one, easily seen on the conveyor. I got to my destination, and the locking mechanism FAILED..!! I put in the correct number combination, three numbers, so not hard to forget, but to no avail. After 30 mins trying to open it, without damaging the lock, I finally called hotel maintenance, and I borrowed a pair of metal snips, and had to cut the zipper tabs to allow me into the suitcase. Not good, and I wouldn’t buy again, stay clear."
Didn’t even last one flight. Suitcase didn’t even last one flight. Luckily I had wrapped the suitcase with a strap otherwise I’d have lost all my stuff. It was completely open.
Quality Suitcase. Very light Suitcase for its sizeThe spinner wheels are fantasticAll in all the case is quality & looks the business <U+0001F44C>
"Light weight, but scuff easily. Light weight, but scuff easily"
Big Orange Case. Great case got this for my girlfriend should be able to see it with ease when it comes though the caracal at the airport all cases look the same these days.
"Great suitcase ,Great price & Great seller.. I have been shopping around for a while for a large suitcase,as for some reason large suitcases are out of stock everywhere??.This suitcase it a good brand,i love the colour and the choice of colours infact my mum is getting one for holiday also.The price is great!And the delivery was very fast!The is just one little thing, it has a combination lock (great) but i was expecting a key as the is a key whole like a master key which i did not get.But saying that i have since searched and apparently no key is provided the key whole is for airports to use to check suitcases (i believe)So great case, great price and a great seller )100% trustworth."
"Recommended. Great sturdy large suitcase, with convenient straps to secure luggage"
Good little case. All the above <U+0001F44D>
"Fragile, impossible to get spare parts. After 2 trips the telescopic handle broke, warranty does not apply, impossible to get replacement. Wasted money"
Well made and a good size for travel. Vibrant colour and a good size for travel therefore easy to manoeuvre due also to its lightweight. Really pleased with this product
"Flimsy and light weight. The product did not meet my expectations, it was very flimsy and was not durable!"
Not sure. Not very versatile for family travel
Zip was broken so unusable.. Just used this for the first time today and found that zip was broken. Seems that the returns deadline was 1 July even though we are only about to use it for the first time.How do we get a refund?
Excellent Quality. This is a quality product at a fair price. My only concern is the flimsiness of the handle which feels like it would break with any stress. Overall very pleased.
"Excellent & practical. Lightweight, easy to use, perfect for wheeling round in a busy airport."
Temperamental lock but easy to manoeuvre. Integrated lock works when it wants but I just bought a small lock to solve this …but the case Is easy to manoeuvre and has handy zipped compartments inside
Good strong case. Marks easily.. This is a good easy case to wheel. Nice and string with good storage sections inside.
quick delivery. great case and holds lots just what i need when travelling
Terrible…..zip broke after one use. Zip bust after one use.
Red suitcase. It is a Brilliant case but American Airlines lost it when I went on holiday last December
"Rubbish case poor quality. Don’t buy, these cases are absolutely rubbish. Had a replacement as 1st one zip wouldn’t close. Amazon were brilliant sent out a replacement. However the morning of my flight the zip on the replacement came apart and wouldnt close near the lock so couldn’t use the lock. Managed to close it and flying home 2 weeks later same problem. Really poor zips in these suitcases. I wouldn’t buy again."
Broke after first use. Wouldn’t allow me a refund. After my first use the zip broke. Refused refund
"Lock not working. Set lock, but then no number worked. Manually tried all numbers too and the gap trick. Three the suitcase into the rubbish bin as I had locked the zipper too while fiddling."
Impressed. American Tourister is always good quality and arrives quickly with Amazon. Can't fault it.
Exchange broken suit case. I’m going on holiday for the first time since I bought these suit cases and when I opened one of them the zip is broke even though I bought them in 2021 can you exchange this for  a new one. I go on holiday on the 09/08/2022.
"If you’re looking a durable quality suitcase, look no further.. The stress of travelling is enough without having to worry about the quality and manoeuvrability of your suitcase. Buy this and you free yourself from those worries and travel just that bit smoother."
Excellent. Well built light weightEasy to manover
Love this case. Easy to push around and lock keeps my items safe. I will be buying another when the prices go down
Holiday time. Great case made well and light for a hard shell case. Nice and large
"Good all round suitcase. Needed a large suitcase for a seven day trip and of course old faithful in the loft turned out to be a 'medium'. Panicked last minute and got this delivered well within the week before departure. I normally like to look at the product before purchase especially because this wasn't cheap but I had little option because of the time restraints presented to me.On arrival I inspected the case and it seemed lightweight and flexible ie: not rigid. Within the case were several zip up pockets. The main compartments has straps and one was with a complete zip up cover. Easily stored seven days clothes, in fact brought too much. Once fully packed and zipped up seemed a robust item.Easy to pull along with casters and long extendable handle. Survived its first trip though a few scuff marks after being thrown around by baggage handlers and being on the conveyor belt when sorting. Fragile souvenirs inside were undamaged.Lock was easy to set....do write your combination down!Hope to have this for many years and may even buy another one for my wife. Okay, it is expensive but the old addage of you get what you pay for applies. So much easier then having a number of smaller bags whilst travelling.  So far so good."
High Quality. Extremely easy to handle and good mobility. I would advise on getting a seperate lock because the lock can be reset with a pen/pin. Space inside the suitcase is really good and allows for a lot of compartments which is nice.
Super lightweight. Really pleased I chose this case  Bought after researching and consulting reviews.  Had considered a Samsonite. Extremely lightweight so even full was nowhere near the luggage allowance weight.  So easy to manoeuvre. Would recommend although I can't comment on durability. I travel quite a lot so will report back.
Faulty item. Arrived with a large dent. Due to late arrival there was not enough time to return this prior to my holiday. Very disappointed
"Its sturdy, and nice!. Its sturdy but lightweigth for few days of travel"
"Robust and light. Case came well packaged, indepth instructions, plenty of room and handy compartments. would recommend."
Bad. Very unhappy with item fist time it was used the zips keeps opening in the middle would not recommend this item
"Spacious, tough suitcase for travel. This case is perfect for 1 or 2 days ways. It is nicely partitioned by each lid, so you can pack things with fear of damage. It is really bright, so very easy to see on the carousel. Having used it a few times for local and international travel it has served well and is still in perfect condition"
"Great Suitcase.. Easy to manoeuvre and very light,"
Good value for money. It’s the same construction and quality as some of the suitcases costing 25% more.
Simply effective. Arrived with small manufacturing fault that bypassed quality control but in fairness was hardly visible but to my hardy inspection.Coloration of the case is perfect for the navy blue.Lock mechanism is pretty standard at the moment and I can only advise that these are prone to damage.Space at 91l is plentiful and certainly more than enough to last a busy week or relaxed two week stop off.Zipper is strong and easy to use.Telescopic handle has too much play and will I believe limit the life if not treated with ultimate respect.Having inspected the case and comparing it to others I have or used it is worth the price paid which was 30% below its RRP. I would not however pay the RRP as I sincerely believe that to be overpriced.
"Excellent. Excellent. However they are popular, so you might want to put a sticker on it. Clearly, that's nothing to do with the people who make suitcases."
Good suit case. Worked exactly as expected will replace other case with the same when needed
"Don't be deceived by it's good looks. The case looks really nice, don't get me wrong, and the quality of the actual plastic is good. However, the issue arises with the extending handle. It arrived and I could immediately tell it wasn't working properly. The quality of this handle is really poor, there are supposed to be four settings but only two of them worked and the actual mechanism of the handle was not working properly - this may have been down to incorrect lubrication of the mechanism or it may have been due to some sort of friction where the handle extends from. The RRP of these cases is ridiculous, they're not even worth the discounted prices you see everywhere for them."
"Top Quality. American Tourister cases are top quality, and this one is no exception"
"Avoid!. We ordered one of these and the lock jammed. We thought it must have been a defective case so ordered another one. The second time we watched a video with step by step instructions on how to set the lock, but the same thing happened again. Struggling to understand all the positive reviews for a product that simply does not work. Awful."
"Suitcase. Bought this suitcase to go on holiday this year. Looks good, is light and easy to use and love the colour. Delivery wasn’t good, had almost given up. Thought it wasn’t going to arrive. Fortunately it then came. I’m happy with my purchase."
"lightweight and stylish. This suitcase is amazing for the price. It's lightweight and you can fit loads. I've taken it on a week away in the UK, and a longer trip abroad. The different sections are great, especially if you're sharing a suitcase with someone. It has a TSA lock built in and it's easy to manouver. Obviously not as good as brands like samsonite, but it's about 1/3 of the price.My only complaint is that the colour wasn't the same as the image - in the picture it seemed more green-blue, whereas in person it's a definite blue. Didn't make a huge difference to me though and I'm really happy with my order."
"Substandard suitcases. Brought 2 of these cases for our holiday, wasimpressed with how easily they moved but that's about it.Both cases at the airport before we'd even checked them in had come undone. The zip on corners had pulled away from each other!! We had to go and buy 2 straps to wrap round them to make sure they didn't completely open and start spilling our luggage everywhere. So totally unimpressed with these cases.As for customer service they're obviously  isn't any as I've emailed them 3 times now, and haven't had so much of a confirmation that they have received them.Don't waste your money on this company search eslewhere"
"Ok for a deal. Looks nice and great colour but had a couple of niggles: -1) The zip is not the best and snags quite often, you have to wiggle it back and forth to get it free.2) if you fill the case then this puts pressure on the extendable handle and you really have to pull and push to get it to operate.I have used it a few times, so not fair to return it, but I wouldn’t buy this brand again."
Knowing there was a TSA lock on. N/a
"Nicely made, sturdy suitcase. Looks almost like new after two travels, not counting small scratches. Items inside properly secured."
Terrible suitcase. Suitcase zip broke after one flight don’t buy!
"Sturdy but poor lock. Suitcase is fine, has enough space and is easy to move, BUT the locking mechanism can be opened by pushing the zippers all the way to the left, they just pop out of the hold. I had to get a separate lock to make sure the case is actually secured."
"Great Manoeuvreability. Great size for a 2 week holiday, expandable and lightweight. Really easy to wheel around & looks good."
Brilliant. Brilliant case light weight & moves with ease. In my case the lock was faulty. Sent it back & got a refund.  It may have been a one off hope so as that suitcase is ideal
Light weight and easy manoeuvrability. After using this suitcase  I have realised that I should have bought this previously instead of my other suitcases…. It is easy to use light weight and handles and wheels are easy to manoeuvre easily when I compared with my other suitcases.
smaller than expected. smaller than expected
"The zip came out after two use. I wanted to love this luggage but the zip came out after using it for just two times, initially I thought it’s cuz I over packed it but no even after me taking out some of the stuffs inside the moment after I close it, it comes open."
"Nice suitcase - used once and battered to bits. Lovely suitcase but doesn't seem to fair well when being handled by baggage handlers.One trip to Greece and it looks battered and bruised, which is a real shame."
"Good, but now doubled the price that I paid!!!. Good, but now doubled the price that I paid!!!"
Looks and feels solid. Extremely light and looks sturdy . But at this point i havnt travelled so it is yet to be tested by the luggage handlers at the airports.
"Amazing company. Excellent customer service, very quick delivery. Case is really light and easy to manoeuvre. Can’t wait to use them for holidays."
"Great piece of luggage. Really love this case. It is very light and easy to move. And so far seems very durable. When it first arrived I thought it looked quite small, but i was amazed at how much I was able to fit into it for my 3 week trip to Canada."
Handle broke even before I got to the airport- kept dropping down.Zip broke on second trip.. Handle broke even before I got to the airport- kept dropping down( annoying).Zip broke on second trip- unusable.
Nice case. This case looks like every other one on the belt
3/4 size case. Nice 3/4 size case for those shorter holidays
Great quality. I’ve a couple of American Tourister bags now so I knew what I was getting. Great colour case and looking forward to post-covid travel!
"Some nice features but ultimately unreliable. The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
 Purchased the case in September 2021 for a short stay in Zakynthos in October, travelling from Uk. Used the case for the 2nd time since purchase in the last week of May 2022, again going to Zakynthos. Whilst checking the luggage in at Zakynthos airport for our return to the UK the case telescopic handle started playing up and refused to return to the closed/home position.The case is now unusable as im concerned the protruding handle may become a snag hazard causing further damage to the case.I'll submit a complaint to the seller and update review accordingly.Other than that I like the case itself, having some genuinely useful features."
"Very satisfied. Very good quality suitcase, lightweight and survived the Greek airport handling <U+0001F61C>."
"Durable suitcase. This is the best suitcase I have ever owned. Deceptively spacious, great manoeuvrability and lightweight."
Great suitcase. Really speedy delivery and good quality item!
Damaged goods from Amazon. This product was not fit for purpose due to damage
Great suitcase. Exact size allowed for most long haul flights.  Good quality.  Internal dividers great to keep clothes in place.  Very pleased.
"Very dissapointed with product. Chose this brand as my previous one was strong enough to survive being dropped by airline baggage handlers from cargo door of a 747 in Barbados and yep that is a fair drop, however was so dissapointed when despite a 90+ percent of positive reviews from previous buyers, this failed badly.  Defective lock meant it couldn't be setup with new combination, otherwise the usual strong and sturdy quality was evident. W-I-P as to returning it"
Broken zip. I received the luggage this week. I cannot review this luggage. As its zip is broken.I have requested a refund.
Zip broke after first use. 
"Perfect and massive - just what we needed!. Great case, job's a good un. Very easy to move and light as well as sturdy. Survived the carousel still looking good too, which our other cases (different make) didn't."
"Small and lightweight with great internal space for 3-4 days of travel. It can hold clothes and the essentials for a short trip of 3-4 days. It separate pockets for shirts and other stuff. It rolls smoothly, it is good-looking, a real charm."
Great product but colour does not match the item.. Colour does not match the item on the picture. Seaport blue.
Great product - poor delivery.. Unfortunately the box came open and the suitcase was scratched at the top.Great product but very poor delivery.
"Great value small case. Bought for train journeys or short stays - first time I’ve had a hard case & once you believe you can’t overfill like a soft case it’s brilliant!  Great storage two sides, held securely. Love the lock for peace of mind. Really easy to manoeuvre."
Good one but the only problem was it cannot be extended. If you are looking for more volumetric space I would definitely suggest  a cloth one not the plastic thing
"Good cases but don't use the locks!. Good value for the cases themselves, they are sturdy and have good internal organisation with straps, netting, integral pouches etc. Smooth rolling on 2 wheels or 4. However I strongly recommend against using the internal combination locks: they are cheap, fragile and prone to breakage. Got locked out of one of my cases by a faulty lock which is now totally jammed and the reset button won't work. Managed to pry the zip pulls out of there quite easily, so it clearly wasn't all that secure anyway. I'll be happy to continue using the bags just without risking the locks on the others!"
The material is soft and not durable. The material is soft and not durable
Came without a handle. Not good. Came without a handle and looks used. Not sure why. Ordered brand new got used with a broken handle
"90 litre clamshell. 90L clamshell with retaining straps in both sections,  internal zipped section for small items, and access to the  braced area under the lining, which is useful for putting books in.  Although the case is itself very light, because of the capacity it is heavy when full.  I use this for cruising and get to the port by train.  I don't fly, so the full weight might be an issue if you do.  I have this in black, so I tie a big hank of fluorescent paracord to the handle, so when I can easily find it amidst a sea of other black cases."
Easy to move around.. Plenty of space and the 4 wheels make it easy to manoeuvre.  The shell is fairly soft and flexible. Very disappointed with the lock.  Got to our villa and it wouldn't unlock. Had to get a knife and prize it open so needless to say it doesn't work now. Expected better for £90
Nice suitcases. Nice
"Very poor quality closing zip.. I have just returned from a trip to Turkey using the suitcase, I had 18 kg of luggage in it, on zipping it closed the zip sprung open so had to secure the case shut using rope and industrial tape to stop contents coming out, the same on the return journey this time with just 15 kg of items in it. VERY VERY unhappy with the quality of the zip. Would not recommend it at all!!!!!"
"retractable handle no longer retracts after just ONE flight.. Took it on one trip right after purchase and the retractable handle no longer retracts.The metal housing that holds the sliding handle is visibly bent (see photos).Suitcase bought on 1st of March, I came home with it after the returnwindow expired (31st March).  Now have to try to get this repaired or replaced.Would not buy this model again.C"
The handle jammed on my first trip. Flimsy - avoid!. Wheels well but expensive for an item that breaks after one trip
Smart. A lovely colour (dark turquoise). The case survived two flights without problem. It is easy to wheel around.
"Utter Junk. Handle gets stuck either in up position or down position. Naturally you don’t find this out until you use the case and you are abroad. It will end up in the bin and be a total write off on first use, having cost £80. Utter utter garbage. BTW no refund available apparently. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK"
"Nice and lightweight. Has a few scratches already but that may be due to rough luggage handlers.  Lovely case so far.  Easy to move, light, chic…."
"Valise très bien, à voir avec le temps..... Paraît un peu fragile..."
. Paraît un peu fragile...
Not fit for purpose. The screws in the towing handle broke on the first day I used this suitcase. It's not fit for purpose. The handle on my Eastpak suitcase is much more robust.
"Failed zips on both cases. I bought two of these cases and both have failed zips - they basically peel open both when doing up in the first place and then when filled.  This happened straight out of the boxes whilst empty the day before our holiday, I had to use them with suitcase straps and again they were useless will be trying to get a refund/replacement - such an important part of a suitcase to get right!"
Lock broke on first use. Good suitcase for holding ur items but if you want them to come out of the suitcase then don’t lock it. I used this case once and thought i must’ve set the combination wrong so went through all 000-999 different combinations and none worked. Tried resetting the combination and every other method of getting in but it’s clearly terribly made.DO NOT PURCHASE!!!IF PURCHASED DO NOT LOCK!!!
"Great case. Great case, seems well built. Combination lock dials a little fiddly"
Spoit by week zip. Unfortunately zip broke after our first two week trip making case unlockable and risking becoming uncloseable. Returned for a refund.
Too flimsy and an ineffective lock.!!. The case itself is a good size but then plastic is too thin. Easily flexed and can see it will be easily damaged when chucked about at by luggage handlers. Also the lock is a joke. Like someone who posted a video of it. The case can be opened very easily thus making it absolutely useless.  My 25 year samonite is so rigid you can sit on it. I think lesson learned. You get what you pay for !!!!
"Great Item. Very good case, lightweight but strong, very easy to move around,  price was good, great colour easy to identify."
Good product. The case looks good and is easily manoeuvrable on its wheels.  Filled with clothing it weighed 21kg.  I like the separate compartment in the lid but would have preferred 2 zippers so that either side could be opened independently.  It was good for one holiday and hopefully will be for many more.
"Lovely suitcase. The suitcase is light, easy to use, good quality and looks lovely."
Smaller than 75cm. This bag is smaller than the advertised dimensions - more like 71cm than 75cm. Had to return for that reason.
Not worth it. I have the Small and Large of this suitcase. The large is Not as well made as the cabin size and Wheels are too small and zips are unreliable. Would definitely purchase a cabin size again but nothing else. Feel like I paid way too much for it.
Had this delivered with a broken zip very poor quality returned both avoid. Poor quality zip came broken out of the box
"Lock not working and zip faulty. I was packed and ready to use this case the morning of travelling to the airport. When I came to set the code on the lock it would not 'click' to allow me set me number. Something is faulty if the lock mechanism doesn't allow me to set a code. I had to use the bag as I was due to go to the airport. The actual bag itself is lightweight and easy to move. On packing my bag on the trip home the zip came out of alignment. It had got stuck a little when I was packing my case for the journey there and wasn't very smooth when using the Ip at one end. My case was not overpacked as we had plenty of other luggage with us for our trip and so did not need to stuff the suitcases. I want to get this fixed or exchanged and it seems I have to pay for and arrange a courier to get this fixed. Surely if it is a faulty product, I should incur any extra charges. The case is only 3 weeks old."
"Poor quality, extending handles and inner zip failed on initial short UK trip.. The extending handle failed consistently from initial delivery. The RHS locking mechanism failed to engage.The inner zip lining failed in transit despite not being overloaded.Both failures were on its inaugural internal flight within the UK. The case was not in the hold, carried personally and failed miserably."
"Large suitcase east to manoeuvre.. Good size, easy to wheel, good lock. It didn't feel that stable, when I unpacked it, but I had it fully packed when I used it and there was no problem. Looks good too!"
Good quality overall-zip quality is poor. One of the zips broke straight away- which made the lock mechanism completely useless-however the build quality is good and everything else about it is good - just the zip let’s it down big time
"Just what we wanted. Lightweight, they move easy on carpet and wood flooring. Haven't used them on a tripyet but still impressed with them. They look sturdy."
"Pleased with my purchase. I’m happy with my purchase of this suitcase, it’s exactly what I wanted."
"It scratched very much first time used on flight, looks tatty already. I like that it was lightweight"
Bought 2 of these!. I got 2 medium for my partner and I. I can't believe how light it is and it's just everything I'm looking for ready for our trip!Highly recommend!
"Zip broke day one!. Suitacase - Don't buy it - shoddy, and not fit-for-purpose.Edit _ No change of view on the quality of the  suitcase - but the customer support from Luggage Superstore was excellent.  They responded quickly and came up with a satisfactory solution."
great. great
"Cute suitcase but poor quality and customer service. Cute suitcase and easy to travel with, with plenty of space. However, having only used the suitcase on a handful of trips, the bottom is already very damaged and scratched. The quality is also poor as you can see by this wheel that just fell apart. When I contacted customer service, I was told I would be responsible for all transport costs to even see if this issue would be covered under their warranty, which feels unfair for a wheel that fell apart after only a couple of trips."
Sturdy. Lovely suitcases very bright and vibrant
Sturdy case and just the right size for our needs. We were looking for a good looking sturdy case in a medium size and this fits the bill
Easy to move. Durable suitcase - lock works well and it’s easy to move around.
"Warning: Not fit for air travel - broke on second short trip.. So, nice size, lightweight medium wheelie case but on second short haul business trip got split by wheels. This goes all the way through so no longer secure or water proof. I want my money back. But no button on amazon to get this."
"Supplier “Suitcase Superstore” have hidden terms and conditions.. Suitcase superstore would not refund full postage for returned faulty item as they have a maximum limit they will refund that is kept secret, until you don’t get the money. Avoid them. Also item sent was not new."
Zip broken already!. Zip has broken on the 2nd use!Who do I contact for a refund?
Sturdy. This is a great suitcase - but just after one use going through the airport the outer surface is all scored to h£ll already - I have another American Tourister case which has been through many’s a time and looks far better - must be new materials they are using. Other than that excellent Quality
"Good Small Cabin Case. As expected, good quality case from American Tourister, smallish so should be fine for all airlines."
Perfect for my needs. Love the colour and seems durable and well made
Very Disappointed. Lock broke on first use. Case cracked on second use.
"Brand new?. Disappointed it didn't come with dust bag or wrapped in protective film. Didn't have that brand new look to it, however Amazon assure me it's brand new. Hope it is and just badly packaged.Update - zip faulty so sending back for a refund."
Looks like it’s been used…. Bit unhappy as it is all scratched and the wheels look used. Not want I expected for a lot of money. Can’t even ask for money back as using it tomorrow to fly.
"Lock jammed within 5 minutes. Lock has jammed 5 minutes after use. I know it's jammed because I spent hours trying each possible combination 1000 times and twice again to be sure. Not only that but if you simply pull on one of the zippers half of the suitcase can be opened, leaving the lock to be pointless in the first place."
Zip is poor. The zip on this suitcase is by far the worst I have ever seen .It is unusable so will be sending it back
Faulty.. It was a Christmas present. My son is now about to use it and the zip is wonky and doesn’t work.
Poor quality. Didn't even get one trip without the inside material tearing. Poor quality product.
Sturdy and wheels well.. Nice case. Seems well made and should last a while.
Good Value lightweight suitcase. I bought this 3 days before my cruise when my much more expensive Samsonite Aeris case had problems locking again. It has proved excellent - lightweight with a simple locking system
Great!!!. Arrived as expected.Well done Amazon for delivery date!!Colour <U+2705>Price<U+2705>Quality <U+2705>
It Holds Cloth's. Seems to be well designed and the colour is lovely.Well that's what my mum says :-) Bought as a gift and it seems to have hit the spot.
"Very poor quality. Bought 2. Arrived and felt quite flimsy but assumed this was due to lightweight construction. Turns out they are just flimsy. Handle snapped off one the first time we used it so returned for a refund. Used the other one for a second time and zip broke - came off the plane open. Would avoid at all costs, not fit for purpose"
"Lock doesn’t work. The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 The left zip can simply moved from the lock when it’s in the locked position, but it is TSA approved… don’t even need the special key. The case is lightweight and manoeuvrability seemed ok but didn’t properly use as returned."
"nothing special. First off you can get this much cheaper from Costco than Amazon. The wheels aren't great at all, if you want to move this in a pull, and then push motion, the wheels just lock out and can tip it over.Then carry pull handle when fully extended is very flexy and slack.The wheels don't feels overly sturdy either having a lot of slop in them.Overall for the price at Costco (less than £80) I'm still returning this as its not good enough to take the weight inside."
"Zip broke the first time I used it!. I bought this case earlier this month, and the zip broke as I was closing it on the first use. As I had a plane to catch at 7:10am and no other case I had to buy a strap at the airport (£10) and taped it all around just praying it would hold. Once at my destination (Switzerland) I had to dump the case and buy another. This means I cannot return the case or ask for my money back. This was very upsetting and stressful all around. DO NOT BUY!"
"Awful lock. Lock broke with 5 minutes, zipper can be pulled out lock with little effort"
"Broken Zip. We used this suitcase once, on a journey from UK to Canada.When it appeared on the luggage carousel at the end of our outward journey on Feb 5th, the zip was broken, and our belongings were hanging out.The zip was irreparable, so we had to abandon the case and purchase another in order to get our stuff home.We would appreciate a refund."
"Great suitcase. Looks really good, expensive and lightweight.I’m still trying to figure out the lock system but will get there when I put my mind to it. Thankfully holiday trip is 2 months away!"
It is everything and more than I expected!!!!. I LOVE my suitcase has made travelling an absolute pleasure!!!! I am a carer so am forever on and off trains.
suitcase could not close - the Zipper was screwed. I saw some of the opinions here. As for the zipper and I was hoping it would not happen to me too but unfortunately the suitcase could not close - the Zipper was screwed - new suitcase!. Hope they refund  me.
Broken zip on first use. Poor standard.. First time used the zip separated.
"Bon Air - Spinner excellent lightweight case. The Bon Air - Spinner really is a light case weight wise, in fact I would go so far as to say it is the lightest suitcase I have ever had the pleasure of owning. It has plenty of space inside with all the usual pockets, well worth the money."
All you need. Can't fault it
"Goof quality and lot of space inside !. I ordered it to fly with Qantas, lot of space inside, good quality, very good price"
"Looks good!. It's for travelling ,nice packaging."
Zip and Configuration not ideal. The zip on this case parted easily after zipping it up with the case a bit over-stuffed (we all do that) and so I think it could be improved with a stronger zip. A further point is that the zip divides the case in two equal halves which can make closing the case awkward as you have the weight of your clothes in the top half (these are contained within a mesh so don't fall out). Everything else works well.
"Not used as yet, but seems perfect for the rigours of airport handler's!. Seems very sturdy and a good lightweight piece of luggage. I have not used it just yet as I travel in May but think it's up to the job to being treated roughly by airport baggage handler's!"
The surface is scratched. I have used this luggage for nearly a month.The surface is scratched when using.
"Great suitcase for serious travelling. Very impressed with this product. Very easy to travel with, lightweight but extremely sturdy and glides perfectly"
"Broken on first use. Too brittle, one long haul flight with a light packed case, base where the wheels are, cracked and broken. Plastic too weak for job."
"Broken on first use. This suitcase was a disaster for me. First, the suitcase locked me out the morning of travel - I hadn't set the combination and the second it locked on 0-0-0 the suitcase would not open. Then, to make matters worse, I noticed at the airport the entire zip  had split apart! How is that acceptable for a suitcase?Lastly, as if I needed any more hassle, I noticed the handle doesn't retract. It is jammed fast half way in the suitcase and won't extend or retract.Do not buy this suitcase!"
"Ideal says Boris. Perfect suitcase, ideal for transporting bottles of wine from the off licence all the way to a party at 10 Downing St"
Mediocre. Really good quality but doesn't fit anything.I fit more in my backpack
"Lock is useless. Lock is useless, used guide and YouTube hints and video , I set code and c as n never click open again, have to force open using pins and chisel and hammer, not used once as not fit for purpose, don’t buy shoddy goods"
This case should be called Titanic as it failed on its Maiden Voyage.. I bought this case late last year from Amazon for an upcoming International Flight.Eventually the Flight took place and I landed in my Hotel only to discove the Back of the case had cracked.On Inspection the Plastic seemed very flimsy but to break on its maiden flight is disappointing.I cannot use the case again for fear of complete Failure and no way to return as I am here for at least 12 months.In the Circumstances I require a complete refund and I will return the case for Inspection if the seller can arrange this.
"Not very strong. Got this for a weeks trip away. There is enough from for clothes for this duration. The suitcase itself is quite lightweight and not in a good way. Firstly the zip bust when the suitcase wasn't even at full capacity. Secondly after my first trip the outer side of the suitcase was cracked. I understand that this make be due to the airline, however you would expect it to last one trip."
"Almost good value. Ive used this suitcase and it’s bigger sizes for about 3 years now and have all worked perfectly. That being said, it always feels like they can break easily and the latest small suitcase I received has problems with the extentable handle locking."
good. very good
Great quality!. These are our favourite suitcases.
Do not buy!. Arrived yesterday. Packed last night and added a few bits this morning. Went to close it and the zip broke on first time of asking. I fly to Thailand in a few hours and am now scrambling round to find a suitcase. Absolutely piss poor quality. Shocking. Do not waste your money.
Terrible zip broken on only second time using. Absolutely rubbish would like a refund zip broken after using twice cases were not over filled either
Zip burst open and made a return flight embarrassing and difficult. Zip burst open and made a return flight embarrassing and difficult
"The zipper on the inside broke on the first use, for this reason DO NOT BUY. The quality of the build snd durability is extremely poor"
Flimsy Broken handle. Case seemed fine but flimsy build means the retractable handle has broken after only 2 months when I took it on a second journey. Lucky second time I was travelling by train.  Unclear how to get a refund/replacement for this.
"Poor zip. Received my case on Tuesday ready for Sunday, filled my case up to find out the zip is broken, so had to rush out and purchase another suitcase, unneeded stress. In feature make sure you check your items staight away."
Totally disappointed. I brought this to travel abroad on the 10th . However as I put on the zip it opened up in several parts and I had to travel with my old suitcases. I have nothing to say and m but will be returning this garbage as soon as I return to the UK.
"TSA lock rubbish. Bought this case as I was due to go on holiday, but as like many it was postponed.When I finally went to use the case and set the TSA lock it did not work. I used the instructions provided, YouTube and called a family member who has a similar case. Nothing worked. I had to buy a TSA padlock to ensure the security of my items.Apart from the lock I think the case is brilliant."
"Looks good and genuine. No complaints at all, arrived well before date, seems genuine. Very happy with this purchase"
"Item looks like it's been used, not what I expected for a NEW product.. "
"Good quality suitcase. Perfect size 55x40x20cm for Ryanair and TAP, maximising all the space you are allowed to use. However you can't expand it to 25cm like some airlines allow, and 20cm is not that deep"
Very pleased. All of it
Buy cheap buy twice. I have used this suitcase one and about to return the UK. The zips on this suitcase are very poor and have broken after one use. The suitcase is not overpacked and weighs 10kg so that is not the reason. I would definitely looking elsewhere for a suitcase
"Very poor quality. The handle doesn't go back after you pull it out. Seems quality issue with the handle. Also, the return process on amazon is pathetic."
Not a great start. Lining has torn at first use.....not happy.
Terrible cheap and broke before first use. Do not buy. Zip fully broke before first trip! Now we are screwed and about to fly. Terrible product
"Zip broke on first time of using. Bought two off these last minute for a long haul flight, as we needed to maximise luggage space. Loaded the suitcase with the normal amount of clothes for our holidays, on doing the zip up, the teeth? came apart which made the suitcase immediately redundant and we had to urgently find a replacement.Weight was approximately 27kg, I say approximately as the replacement suitcase was heavier than the American Tourister.We now do not use the second suitcase as wish to avoid the same thing happening whilst away.Without trying to be two harsh, this was a waste of money.Did try looking on there website as they do go on about there warranty but there are no repair location in the UK, or that is what the website stated"
Not good very slugish. Very bad wheels hard to lug around
"Looks perfect.. let's see. This looks perfect for the job, lightweight but robust enough. Yet to be tested on a journey so we'll see!"
"Handle stuck after the very first use. Used it for the first time on a trip and the handle got stuck, making the suitcase pretty much unusable. Seems like there is some fragile aluminium rail that got bent and is blocking the mechanism..."
"Average product. The suitcase is very good! However, the handle is very flimsy and gets stuck when pulling up and almost impossible pushing it down! Hopefully just a one off"
Excellent value. Nice to look at. Very light. Easily movable and just what I wanted.
"Excellent.. An all round cracking travel case, sturdy, lightweight and, secure"
Terrible. I purchased two of these and the zips on both are faulty. Just what you need when you’re about to fly!
"Great travel suitcase !. Very lightweight, moves smoothly even when heavy. So far great experience."
Very good luggage. Very big. And have alote space. Thanks so much. This luggage was wonderful. And very good. Thank u so much.
Versatile suitcase. Love the colour of this suitcase when it arrived.  Came well packaged and in good time. Love the fact that one side is zipped and you have the restraining straps inside as well.  It is so easy to manoeuvre so it makes it easier to move when walking to and from places.
"Extended handle fell apart on 3rd use.. Initially I thought this was a good buy.  UK - Hong Kong and back...no problem.  On subsequent third use for a staycation, the extended handle just fell apart and became totally useless. I won't buy it's replacement online, preferring to SEE what I'm getting.  Lesson learned."
Don’t buy. Zipper broke when packing.  Terrible quality. No way to contact seller for refund.
Very good item. Delivered on time and in good condition
Very impressed with case. I'm going to use it to go on long hall holiday
Broke on first use!. Zip broke on first use In the airport
Bag is handy and beautiful.. Light weight for travelling.
Good Product. Just good. I like it
"Very good suitcase. Very good suitcase, and rolls well"
"Worth its price, perfect for travelling. Bought used suitcase however arrived brand new, without single mark. Suitcase is very capacious, can fit lots of clothes and other stuff. It is also sturdy, took it on holidays and packed 30kg both ways, survived the journey being slammed by airport staff. Totally recommend this company to everyone who would like to travel and not stressed if their suitcase arrives in one piece."
"Not sturdy at all , broke after 1 trip. Awful"
Stunning suitcase. Really good suitcase you won’t be disappointed
Shoddy quality. Zipper broke after one trip and cannot find a contact to report this to
Good case. Nice lightweight bag and sturdy
Perfect hand luggage. Love these. Bought 4 in different colours. Perfect size for hand luggage - within maximum dimensions allowed on Ryanair.
Useless. The zip broke during our first trip abroad....useless
Damaged. Arrived damaged. Not happy.
Excellent case. This was the second American Tourister suitcase I have bought for my wife after being very impressed the design and quality of the in hold case I first bought.. I also bought two for myself as well. That gives an absolute thumbs up for these cases from me doesn’t it.
The coulor is not what it said.. I ordered specifically a turquoise suitcase for my daughter and received a blue one. Very dissapointed.
Lightweight & great movement. Really lightweight but sturdy. And great motion in all directions.
Perfect. I like it
"Love it. It's really light weight, I like that you can close one side on the inside , so it doesn't get messy. The lock works great, it rolls easily and I love the colour:)"
"Broke after 2 trips. After one away, on a train not even a plane, the stitching on the divider gave up. Doesn’t appear to have been properly folded in and seamed so frayed and pulled out. After six months of radio silence from the American Tourister customer service team, chasing them up and being given warranty repair links to the wrong country and then asked to spend £15 on couriering it to them for an assessment, I am well and truly sick of it and will never buy any product of theirs again."
"Do not buy. Poor quality, zip breaks easily.. Do not purchase. Zip broke before even using the suitcase. And due to amazons poor return service after 30 days they were unable to offer any compensation."
"Amazing suit case. What a case , amazing value on prime day and everything I wanted in a case , all I need now is chance to go on holiday"
"Compact, lightweight and pretty. Exactly what we needed for our holidays. Highly recommended"
Good Quality. Good Lightweight product
"Light and strong. These suitcases are amazing, strong good looking and the name alone says they are great"
handle. handle is has two level first level is not stable as second level
"Prompt service, great buy!. Really impressed as this suitcase arrived the day after I ordered it. A beauty of a suitcase - lightweight - and I found it easy to manage over different types of road surfaces! A great buy!!!"
zip bad quality. zip bad quality
Very light. Very good quality
"Good sturdy product. overall satisfied with it and looks good, sturdy built"
Fantastic. Very good and cheap price
Timely delivery. Like it. It's light and convenient
Light. Good and light
It's a very nice looking suitcase .. I like how it looks
Very lightweight. very lightweight.. have not tried to use it though. hopefully it would last a long time.
"Great case!. really great case, you can fit lots into it, it can be used as cabin bag or for weekends away, lightweight and moves along really well - would highly recommend."
Love the colour!. Good protective case for travelling.
"Nice case but. I really liked it but unfortunately I had to send it back as I found it was a lot smaller for a L suitcase, even compared to the one I had at the time. Ended up getting a different one that had a bigger capacity. Depends what you are looking for, but design and quality were solid, hence my rating."
"Suitcase came broken!!. The lining inside this suitcase ripped before I even had the tags off, and the zipper was broken when I unwrapped it. So disappointed, need a refund."
"Very happy with the purchase. I bought it for my daughter , she loves it!"
Superb!. Fantastically wrapped and very good value!
"Zip is terrible, which means it is now useless!. Bought 3 of these - problem is the zip - it breaks really easily - result, case (not closed!) Really annoyed - don't recommend"
great and strong. light and strong
"Great. Solid travel case, but still reasonably lightweight"
awesome. it was best
"Good suitcase. The suitcase is light, spacious and easy to manoeuvre"
Avoid. This case looks attractive- it’s totally useless- first use and zip has broken
"Great little case. Compact, smart, secure lock , bought to match larger suitcase"
Amazing. Amazing product
Perfect. Perfect
Best suitcase I have owned!<U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FB>. It’s strong and light and has plenty of room for what I need to fit in there <U+0001F603>
Good reliable product. A smart and robust luggage case.
all. Perfect!
Quality is not very good. But it's lightweight. The product is very lightweight but the quality is poor. I think didn't the the money I paid for.
Great product. Lightweight and yet solid suitcase. Love it
love it. great suitcase lots of space and compartments  i recommend
Zip broke the first time I used it to travel abroad.  So how am I supposed to return it?. The zip broke the first time I used it to travel on a plane. Nightmare.
Send used one. Absolutely disappointed i order brand new but receive used one and lot of mark.Complete used one i sent many emails for replacement but again disappointed i would not recommend at all.
"A Samsonite by any other name..... Having made at least a dozen trips with this suitcase now, I can honestly say it's a great piece of luggage. Lightweight, robust and a smooth roller. If you don't want to (or can't) shell out the premium on a Samsonite branded case, this is your answer."
"Broke after one use!!!. Zipper broke after one use, not good quality. Would like a full refund!!"
"Great midsize suitcase. Fantastic suitcase. I have 2 larger cases from same maker, this one is for the wife for 1 week trip. Great manoeuvrability, and lightweight. Great buy at great price."
"<U+0001F44D>. Good,  but slow delivery and little bit expensive than the market"
Brilliant suitcase!. I just love this suitcase and will definitely buy it again! It is super light and easy to maneuver and that makes the difference.I got it in turquoise and the colour is just lovely. I have been recommending this brand to my family and friends ever since.
"Seems good and strong. I bought the deep turquoise and I absolutely love it! I cannot give a full review since I didn’t try it yet, but it seems very good quality! I hope it lasts for long time!"
"Arrived missing 2 screws in the handle. A suitcase arrived missing 2 screws in the handle. For this reason, the handle easily falls out of the suitcase's rails and make it really hard to move especially when loaded."
"faulty zipper. The zipper opens, sometimes...for a 100 pound suitcase it is very disappointing, cannot refund cause I took a flight straight away, had to wrap it up with protective film at the airport. Also the material gives an idea of cheap plastic."
Really good bag. I really do like this bag! the wheels are great and the build quality is good. It's also rather lightweight for it's size.
"Good quality ñ. Good quality and strong suitcase, just the space was not good divided for my gf and it was a present for her. But I notice that the hard case kind for suitcases are like that so it is not this suitcase fault."
"Really great!. Lightweight, sturdy, but does scratch / mark easily. So much lighter than previous hardshell cases.I'm really pleased with this - good value too!"
"Very happy with this suitcase. I bought this suitcase because I had already seen someone else's American Tourister and I was impressed. It is very lightweight but at the same time quite strong. The wheels are quite sturdy and it was easy to manoeuvre. I remember reaching Madrid and my taxi left me in front of the wrong hotel and disappeared. So I had to go up and down a little, asking for directions, checking maps etc. Fortunately my destination was within walking distance and the suitcase was very easy to handle on its wheels. Very happy with this product, definitely recommend."
I love it. Really nice finish for a durable case lovely pale pink colour.It cames with all sorts of zips and compartiments to organize your clothes also with a handy security locket.The4  wheels are soft and smooth and also the handle has a soft touch.
Poor quality zip. Bad zip! It opens up even though bag has a lock on it.
Not as robust as I expected. Is ok for the discounted price. I would never buy a full price as I feel isn’t as robust as I expect from a brand like A Tourister.
"What to do with a faulty suitcase when there is no clear returns process?. Having bought the suitcase late last year - in anticipation of travelling extensively in 2020 (which clearly hasn't happened due to COVID19), I have not used the suitcase. I have now started packing for a trip, only to find that the suitcase handle does not extend fully, making it utterly useless. Despite the two year warranty provided by American Tourister, there appears to be absolutely no way to access this via Amazon.What a shambles - how am I meant to return faulty items? Any and all advice would be gratefully received."
Not bad a couple flaws. Inner zip for pouch broke first time packing otherwise all fine
Great little weekend case. Bought this for my partner - fantastic quality and manoeuvrability - perfect for a weekend away.  Doesn't fit too much but perfect for packing light for a quick trip away.
"Great quality, long lasting. Like the lightweight case. Durable. Hood quality. Used it many times and it's as good as new"
"So far So Good. So far I'm happy with this case, I've not actually used it yet as I fly out in a months time, but the different components and the  wheels make this a good buy for the price it cost."
"Measure your required size and check your colours properly. This product is exactly as described. Delivery was as stated. The only thing I would say to be wary of is the colour spec. I ordered one thinking it looked teal/turquoise in the photo. It’s actually blue and not at all turquoise or teal and it’s also a lot smaller than I anticipated. The sizing is clearly stated but I didn’t check the actual measurements and assumed it would be the large size that I already have one of. Turns out the one I already have must be extra large because this one was definitely the next size down which I was disappointed about!! Saying that, the case is a beautiful case, lightweight, sturdy and spacious so I ordered another one in a contrasting colour of yellow! Excellent product but make sure you check your measurements and your colour properly!!!"
"A little too flexible - if at the bottom of a large pile of cases, contents could be squashed. I ordered the red version, which would have stood out well at the baggage reclaim! The wheels looked fairly rugged, as the four wheel cases go. The corners seemed quite strong, but when pressing down on the middle of the case, there was a lot of flexing, which would probably lead to whatever was inside being crushed, if several heavy suitcases were loaded on top of it in an aircraft hold.So I had to send it back and continue the search for a strong enough case."
"Great purchase. Haven’t used it yet or even opened it but I love be it so far, the colour is great, it moves easy, is light, yet feels solid"
Easy to use. Great quality
Lightweight suitcase. Can't believe how light it is with manoeuvring where you go.
Handy & beauty. Nice and handy
Looks good. I bought 2 xl in 2018. Now I bought extra 3 xl size. The features and quality is good. The only thing concerned is scratches with too travelled use.
Great suitcase. Great quality lightweight cases which look really smart. I bought in 3 sizes and love them. Easy to manoeuvre and have the built in combination lock.
"Smaller than what describe. Good material , but it is smaller that what described . They said it can take up to 32 Kg . However 24 Kg is the maximum that can fit for"
"Perfect carry-on!. Light, durable, and looks great! Only comment is that it is easily scratched on the surface."
Good bargain. The product overall has ample capacity but the quality on the outside is not that great as I have been getting from the other American tourister bags. However considering that I got it at almost 50% off so it was a good bargain.
"Great luggage. Great product! Lovely turquoise colour and Looks really nice and strong. Quick ship and dispatched, thanks"
<U+2764><U+FE0F>. <U+2764><U+FE0F>
"Very good. Really great little carry on case. Looks good, lightweight, easy to manoeuvre. Seems to be very good quality, only used for one short haul journey so far but seems great."
Good value for money. Good value for money and perfect for a one-week travel
Very pleased. Beautiful case
"Not the most reliable product. I ended up returning this item- I guess you get what you pay for! It felt fairly flimsy, the surface looked like it would damage very easily and it looked quite cheap. I didn't have much confidence in it surviving many trips and as I usually only ever travel with hand luggage I decided that paying a bit more would make all the difference."
"Thumbs Up!. I like everything about this luggage- from its color to its weight to its size and durability.Its light pink color brings all the girly vibes out. It stands out when you're amongst the crowd. You won't ever lose it, as it is very easy to spot even from a distance.Very nice size for a checked in luggage. It is very lightweight. However, I dont suggest using this for travels with low baggage allowance. It is very spacious and could fit a lot in it-- you can go over your allowance."
"good choice. comfortable, light and practical. Ideal for weekend getaways or trips of a few days. I use it for business trips and I feel comfortable. The quality is not the best but balanced compared to the price!"
Perfect for Travelling <U+0001F9F3>. Fabulous case!
"smooth and sturdy. Great quality, smooth and sturdy"
Sturdy and Good. This was perfect and it has good mobility and nice to handle
"Well suited to its' role. An ideal sturdy suitcase, lightweight and easily manoeuvrable"
Versatile easy  life fhtweight and colour. Love Travelling but on hold for the moment due to  the virus
Brilliant on all levels. Was recommended by a friend and has been perfect purchase
"Good quality and light. Easy to use, smooth and light in weight. Top quality."
Suitcase Envy. Thought I would get a new suitcase after watching an airport program where baggage handlers said they hated the old style hard two wheeled suitcases. Mine always cane out last but now they come out next to each other. Super easy to wheel about. Nice bright colour
Damaged. The outer case was filled with scratches along all the edge.
Terrible zip. Zips are terrible. They come apart and difficult to zip round the corners. Not worth the price
"Good deal, good quality. Excellent case very pleased"
"Love this case. perfect, holds a fair bit and stood up to the bashing of the flight handling, would highly recommend.  Doesnt need any extra locks as it has the in-built 3 digit lock."
Cabin baggage. Perfect for the regular traveller .fits perfectly in the overhead lockerHighly recommend
Perfect. Perfect !!
Bright bag. Not easily lost. It’s so bright you see it on the conveyor
"Absolutely delivered on all fronts.. If you're going round the world with eleven flights and a dozen different places to stay, you want something that is secure, reliable and takes the knocks on and off planes and in and out of cars and trains. Both cases have lived up to their hype and are good to go again. Shame my wallet isn't up to another trip."
Great quality and very easy to manouever. Love this case. Quality is superb -very roomy and great value for money
lovely case. no problems
Zipper quality. The zipper was broken in our first travel
Non. None
Great bag!. Love it!
A great buy. i have had this for 3 years and it is great. i have travelled extensively in those 3 years and it still looks great. i always put my laptop in it and nothing inside has ever been damaged. well worth the money i paid for it
"Absolute terrible quality - this brand has cheapened. I don’t know what has happened to this brand but the quality is shockingly bad now - I packed it, wheeled it to my car, 5 minutes later took out of car and unzipped - zip snagged and tore teeth - no pressure placed on zipper and the case was considerably ‘under packed’. To ask for £80 odd for this trashy quality plastic and cheap, cheap, I MEAN SERIOUSLY CHEAP and brazenly shoddy zip, is a disgrace. Terrible junk, absolute garbage. Requested refund, which has been accepted, sent back product."
Essential for travel. Best for travels! Light weight and strong!
Great purchase. Look great
A tough and versatile case. After 5 years still in good shape except the extendable handle jams every so often.
Lovely case. Lovely caseBright colour so you can see itStraps and zipped inside case nice
Yellow <U+2764><U+FE0F>. My daughter loves the suitcase
Amazing. I love it so much. It’s light and I can bring it everywhere
Size of case. Great case.
"Good Case on 4 wheels.. I’m constantly touring and my cases suffer great punishment in baggage handling centres around the worlds airports.The case is easy to keep clean, identify and pack. Not too heavy and wheels go where you want them to.The zip on the inside has poor stitching and has frayed through but it’s not a big issue and being as I can’t be without it have elected not to do anything about it."
Great quality. Only used it twice but very happy with it. Would definitely recommend
Buy it!. Great travel companion ! Easy light and durable
Very light and good materials quality. Very good quality!
Love it. Love it
Great. Great case
"Great value for money and built like a tank. Bought for my fiancée because I already owned an AT case. It’s fanastic quality, benefits from the built in zip lock with TSA lock release so it’s never going to come through security held together with tape if they need to check your case! The four wheeler design makes getting through airports, train stations and one and off buses, trams, trains and planes an absolute breeze"
Excellent. Bought this for my mum for Christmas and she was over the moon! So light yet sturdy and half the price that they’re sold for in Fenwick which was where I almost got one first. I’ve always purchased American tourister as they’re great value for money. Samsonite quality items but with a different brand
ZIP Broken. The zip went on this after 2 uses. Managed to correct it but on the last trip over christmas it went again and managed to close case but zip is broken. Purchased in April 17 so out of guarantee but only had 5 trips. So not very happy as this was an expensive purchase.
Amazing!!!!!. Very good but I feel it will break easily
Good case. good
"Wheels make this case So easy to move around. Second one of these Bon Air cases. Bought a bigger one for long haul 3 years ago. This one perfect size for stop and drop shorter hols.Sturdy, no scratches, Lots of room and fabulous colour."
Sturdy suitcase. Excellent suitcase which took a week's clothing without issue. Also feels sturdy and looks good.
"Medium quality travel suitcase. Handle is not solid, trouble of breaking when taking in and out"
"Good bag but handle doesn’t work. This bag is a great size and weight. But if you have anything inside of it, the handle will not come up. I don’t know if I got a defective one or what, because I know American tourister is normally a trusted brand."
All in all good case for the money. Used for my 3 week honeymoon and although I didn’t need all the space it was nice to have the extra space to throw in cloths rather than fold. The shell deforms a bit when other cases are stacked on it but no damage and my case wasn’t full. All in all good case for the monies
"Great!. Great suitcase, light, looks good, easy to manoeuvre. Bought two more."
Best cabin case I’ve owned. Perfect cabin case
Good sized case with inside pockets to devide up your packing. Good hard shell case only problem is bring able to get into it when the instructions for the zip locks are on the inside of the case luckily I had family that had used this system before as I hadn't
Good price. There is so much room also easy to change lock conbanation and moved along having 4 wheels
"Value for money. Worth every penny. Sturdy, spacious and nice design. Zip is really strong."
A really nice suitcase. Really good suitcase
Perfect for family holidays. Good capacity.. Product was as described.
<U+0001F44D>. <U+0001F44D>
Great valu. A really good purchase
"Not the quality you expect from the company name, cheap material. The zips are not very good quality compare to the name of company. I had the small one and decided to buy the bigger as well. I am not ss satisfied with this one as the small cabing one. the smaller had much more better wuality of material and zips. this seems like a deformable plastic which worries me every time that may break during travelling. The wheels also makes wierd noises."
Bright and light. Great lightweight case and easy to see on the carousel
"Good all round medium size case. Well made, lightweight, ideal for travel."
Nice Looking. Tidy item
"Excellent !!!. Very happy with the purchase. The suitcase is sturdy, spacious & easy to carry. So far used it for international travel & the Tourister did survive the baggage handlers."
Very good thanks. Great product
"Good quality, great manoeuvrability and nice pockets inside.. Lovely case with great storage compartments inside for keeping your luggage organised. Well made and good looking."
"Adjustable multi-stage push button locking handle issue. Hi,Since I got it, it had a problem with the adjustable multi-stage push button locking handle but I didn’t had the time to change it before going on holiday. It jumps from the middle one.I used to have the same suitcase in yellow and it would hold if i would lift it on the side walk or a few steps up but this one, it just doesn't.Clearly is a problem with just this product.Over all is a very good product."
"Quality. I was expecting a darker colour. Anyway I love it. Good quality, the main thing."
"Good purchase. Everything great with this item, the weight, the space, the wheels or even the shape. The only thing (at least with the yellow colour) is that the colour is not as bright as the picture. Apart from this, as mentioned before, all good with that!"
We have now bought 3 !!!. Originally bought 2 to replace a Xlarge and Large case. I have to say these cases don't look massive but we managed to store more than enough clothes in them. We decided to buy a 3rd and this will cover a family of 4 for two weeks easily (inc 2 women who take a lot of clothes ). They are really light compared to our old fabric cases which help with those baggage allowances. Also really easy to move them when fully loaded. Used them once and expect these to last us a long time with usage 1 -2 times a year
5/5<U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>. Worth every penny 5/5
"Brilliant. In use constantly, and absolute gem and well priced we bought two"
"Good overall, but a bit lacking in capacity. The zip design on either side of the case makes for a lack of combined space that you would get with a regular case for holding bigger items, so I feel the capacity isn't as good as it could be. Still though that's part of the design and it has its upsides too. Overall it's very well built and sturdy, have used for 2 flights so far and hopefully many more to come."
"Amazon, ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. For the best part of a month I have trying to return this item & also another same size in blue. Amazon is incapable of organising suitable collection. I have stayed off work 2 days in a row. No driver has appeared. Very unhappy, I only want to return these to then re-buy a bigger size. Amazon GET YOUR FINGER OUT!!! Someone call me! 10 Dec 2019 17.00pm"
Waste of money. I bought this back in October for my holiday in December. I’ve packed the suitcase only to find the zips are bust! I’ve no time to buy another but have had to secure my items in the case with a lot of straps. Really disappointed as I was in love with the case and couldn’t wait to use it.
"Did not turn up, not in stock!. Nothing wrong with product, just bad web service from provider who doesn't know what is in stock!"
fantastic. great brand and service
It’s a good value for money.. This product is really good value for money.Thank you! I highly recommend this seller! He is very responsible!
"Amazing luggage. Love it, very spacious"
Just nice. Also was half priced back then which was nice. Nice. So nice.
Great price. Great price
Good. Good
Handy. The best luggage ever bought
Tidy case. Good not too small
"Well Pleased. Same as Samsonite very well built good castors cavernous capacity got these a couple of days before we had to go away for a fortnight ,  Very manoeuvrable easy to carry . Well pleased"
"Budget case. This is a budget case, it's good value for money but it won't last forever. The wheels in particular look unlikely to last very long. If you intend trundling across poorly-maintained airport car parks with this case, the wheels barely look ""up to the job"".The combination lock is a fancy design I hadn't come across before. I'm not sure why they have done this.The only other thing I would add is that the measurements specified include the wheels. So if you go by the measurements alone, you might find the actual case is amaller than you expected."
Excellent product. Excellent product! Fitted much more into the cases than initially thought as was sceptical that I should have bought the bigger size. This proved  to be no the cases at all and they are more than suits for my needs. Would definitely recommend.
"Best holiday case I've had. This has been a fantastic buy. Extremely easy to move about, the wheels feel like it's gliding on air!Lightweight and very spacious.We use separate padlocks in addition to the built in lock system. Makes it a very secure case.Bright colour means it is fantastically easy to find on the carousel when at the airport."
lightweight and cute. I have the larger one of these 2 and thought this would be perfect for taking into the cabin with me for short trips.  love it.great size and light weight. and really like the zip over cover on the left side to keep things extra secure.  definitely recommend American Tourister!!
"Nice colour. I like the case and used it for a trip to France in the summer, it did get a bid dent in it (Thanks BA) which I was able to push out, small discoloration of the plastic but all ok.  The wheels are very good which is the main feature i was looking forward to using."
Good but lock broke after limited use. Lock broke after first use
Perfect. Good lightweight but practical case
Lovely suitcase. Excellent but need to try on journey
"Very light. Good quality, nice style and very light !"
"Great little cases!. I have 4 of these now, great little cases, perfect for short haul. Cabin size, only issue is handle sometimes slips, think something needs tightening!"
Quality is outstanding. Simply love it
"Tough but light.. Great case, light-weight for size. Excellent wheels. Survived a long haul flight straight away after purchase."
Lovely suitcase - handle broke in less than a year. Really loved this as a present for my daughter as she needed something sturdy to go to and from Uni. This came and seemed very well made however the handle broke in less than a year. To be fair I have not contacted the sellers but feel very disappointed as paid a bit extra hopping this would last a little longer.
It's good over all. It's very handy for short travels
Have reordered. Superb  ....... have reordered
Well made. Used for the first time on recent trip abroad. Locks and zips seem well made as do the handles and wheels. Very easy to manoeuvre. Very pleased with it so will buy another when required.
V PLEASED. Good product.
"Great case, great seller!. Love the bag. Let me start with the color, the orange it’s really bright, I just live it. Very compact. The seller is great, it arrive on the next day and the packing...was just brilliant. Very well protected."
Great. The best travel bag to take on a aircraft.
Excellent. Ticks all the boxes ...... Excellent purchase. Arrived on time.
All good. My favorite brand
Prompt. Came promptly. Good price quality
Great suitcase. Great suitcase at a very reasonable price
"Excellent suitcase,worked perfectly. I used this suitcase for my first trip abroad to Thailand so I needed something to work flawlessly and give me no worries as I had enough as it is lol and it didn't disappoint I was able to fit everything I needed for the trip and still be below the maximum weight required by the airline also.The suitcase no doubt got banged around and marked but it didn't break or fail at all goin threw the 6 airports and 4 planes altogether on the trip.I absolutely would recommend this as its excellent and I would say if it was rubbish but its absolutely brilliant.Buy it you won't regret it."
Versatile. Greta suitcase!
As described. Just as described fast delivery
Compact & Stylish. Light weight and easy to use
"Great case. Bought for my 10year old for our summer holidays- She loved it. Great Colour, lightweight, easy for her to wheel around a very busy airport. The case has 2 pockets in the inner top which was very handy It comes with built in lock which is great but a bit fiddly, although she loved that part."
"Good strong suitcase. The suitcase isn't as hard as I would have liked, but still strong enough nonetheless.It is easy to wheel about even on uneven surfaces. It is lightweight, so it is relatively easy to lift into the car.It is quite big inside and has pockets on the inside divider, which is good for storing smaller things, such as toiletries."
Ideal carry on luggage. Perfect.
"Excellent. Everything as advertised, excellent service and fast delivery"
"Sturdy, lightweight and manoeuvrable. This is our third American Tourister.  Other two are still in use but as the family gets bigger we need to carry more and these ones can carry plenty of items but is still easy to manoeuvre.  Great colours as well so easy to spot when yours arrives on the carrousel."
good. good
"Good, lightweight suitcase. Great, very happy with it."
Fantastic case!. Very lightweight and manoeuvrable. Slightly more flimsy than other hard cases but it’s super lightweight so that’s not surprising. Highly recommended!
Disappointing. Packed the night before holiday and zip kept coming undone even when the case was not overpacked ! It happened each time we did the zip up so had to return as couldn’t risk this happening when in use.Old case in the loft was not what we wanted to use but had no choice.Frustrating and disappointing as this is not a cheap case.
"These look like fakes :( :(. I just bought two of these cases.  When I unzipped the cloth cover inside I found a horror show.  Rough, cheap screws are used to secure the components like the wheels on to the case.  These screws are so poor they will tear at the cloth.  However, to overcome this,some cheap little stickers have been placed over the screws as you can see from the pictures.  I am dreading these cases are not going to last their first trip."
Value for money. The suit case was very light and easy to move and easy to find on the conveyor belt. Got a bit confused with how to work the locking system
"Fit for purpose.. Arrived promptly, looks good, well constructed with sleek design. Very smooth movement."
Lock code failed. Less than 12 months after purchasing this item the security code on the lock failed (code no longer worked) resulting in a forced opening thus rendering the case useless
Lightweight. Easy to fill and separate the clothes.
Inner zip not working. Inside zip not working but no time to send back as leaving so having to make do !
Very impressed. Classy and quality product.
"I love the colour. It’s lightweight, it’s very easy to manoeuvre and the colour is really pretty! Arrived the next day!"
"Poor zip quality. We bought three medium sized Bon Air spinners. Can’t be faulted for light-weight and manoeuvrability but the zips on the two black cases were awful. With only 11kg packed weight, one zip popped on the way to the airport. Managed to close it but it was open on the carousel on arrival. Amazon have sent a replacement.  The turquoise one seems more hard wearing - different manufacturer? I expected more from this brand! My advice - zip up your cases carefully."
Good product for short haul travels. I have been using this suitcase for nearly a month. So far I cannot complaint on anything. It does its job and quite easy to handle.
Great value on Amazon. Bought this with Prime after checking it was the best deal in the market. The Black colour is discounted the most.The quality is good
Great value for money.. Not as big as I thought.
Great for weekends away.. This case looks great and is quiet.
Not used yet. Looks good
Worth the money. These are brilliant. Light weight; hold lots of stuff and are very easily manoeuvred. Great product
Good product but let me down. Looks great but broke in first outing and as such became unusable for rest of holiday - very very disappointed
Strong but light weight case.. Great light weight case for travel.
Strong lock. Lots of space and zip is very good and strong lock with easy swivel wheels
Great product. Great product just back from Dubai and they have taken a hammering. Got a few marks but great product highly recommended
Worth the money. You can buy cheaper suitcases but this is worth the extra investment.  Good value for money.  Should last for years! Moves VERY easily in all directions.
"Good value travel case. Needed a low cost suitcase for long haul holiday. This case met our expectations, and was good value and happily recommend."
Not worth the money!!. Too flimsy.....Very light weight but dents easily.Light colours get dirty fastVery expensive for the quality.
"Low quality. I purchased this bad few months back. I have used it to travel exactly twice, a d already the zip seems to to have ripped off. Honestly speaking I am very disappointed with the quality as I thought with American Tourister I would be getting a hight quality product to last me a good few years."
Perfect!. Good overall  quality. Would recommend.
"Travel case. Bought for a present, they absolutely loved it. Looks nice and is very well made"
Great suitcase. Brilliant suitcase - my daughter loves the colour
Great case. Great purchase very lightweight but strong
Excellant value for money. Exactly what I wanted. Plenty of room. The code for the lock is easily set. The wheels move freely
Disappointed for the price. Good manoeuvre and space but hand grip is only on top so cannot lay luggage on side? Very strange for luggage especially at this price and quite disappointed that it didn't have the basics
Great product!. Excellent spinner. Good durability. Good price. Sure it's not the most  aesthetically appealing cabin bags out there but it's a jet black that you can't fault.
Lightweight and Robust. Nice piece of luggage reasonably priced. Very lightweight. 4 Wheels make it easy to transport.
Really Good. Very happy with this purchase. Good price and really good quality
Money worth it. Good product
Quality is bad. There is a scratch on the box
"KEY FOR LOCK NOT PROVIDED. Pointless selling this on the basis of its security features if you don't include the key for the lock. If you can provide me with the key, I'll be more than happy to reevaluate and amend this review."
"Great lightweight case. Fantastic case, very light and easy to manoeuvre, lots of space"
"Great case...only get's scratched a lot. This case is definitely light and very easy to move around. I've ordered it black and on my 1st trip it got very scratched. Almost looks like I have it for a few years.However, the space inside is very decent and the zippers very well placed."
not new product. obviously a used product with a lot of marks on it
Excellent quality. Very good quality for a fraction of the price of a samsonite
"brilliant. stacks of room,great quality.Have now used on two long haul trips and no damage ,wear or complaints"
Perfect cabin luggage!. Perfect cabin luggage!
Good product. Looks good and very light
"Lighter. There is not as much space that is required for long trips, is not expandible"
"Highly recommended. Very happy with this purchase, bought the cabin size as well."
"Poor Quality!. The lock is defective, it cannot be reset from the default combination. (I have followed numerous videos online but the reset button is jammed). The anodised finish on the zipper sliders is badly corroded and unsightly, not what I would expect from a brand new product. I would have returned the suitcase for a refund but there is not enough time as my trip is in a few days. I have purchased a combination lock at my own expense so I can use the suitcase. Wouldnt recommend the seller as they clearly don't check the quality of their stock before shipping."
Very poor quality.. We bought the suitcase four years back and used it only for four international trips. It was only a spare so very lightly used. One of the wheels is now completely broken with half of the rubber missing. It’s by far the worst suitcase we have ever bought.
Stunning. Perfect
ok. ok
Qualiry!. Great lightweight strong case!
Great suitcase. Lightweight & manoeuvrable & looks good
Great. Color is nice and exactly as advertized. lightweight. grazes and marks are noticeable though. Otherwise good product.
"Not built to last. I bought this case as i needed a large suitcase for a holiday in Japan, it arrived and i was impressed by how good the case is it's well built and spacious and it served me well the first two times i went on holiday, but on the third trip i noticed that the suitcase was moving very strangely and it wasn't until i had gotten home and inspected the now empty case that i realised that three of the wheels had either broken or partially exploded.So reluctantly i leave only a two star review as even though it was great value for money you expect to get more than three trips out of it."
"Good product. Light to travel with,durable and  easy to manoeuvre"
"Handle would not extend, case has never been used, a very disappointing purchase.. The case arrived a little later than expected, but was well packaged. However, on removing the case from the package the handle would not extend fully due to a faulty mechanism. The case has never been used. On further inspection, the handle will not extend if the case has been tightly packed with clothes (approximately 7 - 8 kilogrammes). On reducing the amount of clothes in the case, the handle will extend successfully."
Problem with handle. Product ideal but handle issue. It keeps collapsing in without pressing a button. Second case this has happened to and will avoid.
"Very good. Very good, good price"
<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>. Really nice looking suitcase. Lightweight and easy to manoeuvre.
Great. Great thank you
Good value luggage!. It has survived intact from the Manchester airport baggage handlers so no complaints so far!
Good!. Pretty happy with this product. Used it twice for a 3-4 day travel and it hasn’t disappointed yet. I’ve read that it can slip in water and the wheels are not sturdy enough so will hopefully update here in a couple months time. Overall happy for now.
"ideal for a week for 2 people. great case, deceptively large and sturdyplenty of room to hold enough clothes for 2 adults for a week"
"FANTASTIC SUITCASE!. Fantastic suitcase - looks stylish, robust material, great interior and space, high quality handles and wheels. I contemplated buying a cheaper one but this is definitely worth paying a bit extra for. Only potential negative have seen from other reviews the case scratches / gets marks on it quite easily, have only used it a few times and noticed minor marks but my case is black so hardly noticeable - if you choose a lighter colour they may be more visible with repeated use. Some cases have scratch proof material (it can still get scratched of course but harder to mark) American Tourister should have used it on this but if you don't care about scratches or marks appearing on the outside then not a problem. This case is lightweight too and made of robust materials and should last you a long time i.e. years."
Looks like a breath mint :). Really lightweight but very solid. Looks great too. All my suitcases have been American Tourister for years and still have no reason to change that
Best lightweight case. I already have the carry on version of this case and it’s proved its worth. I needed a medium size case that would withstand check in when travelling further afield. I chose a matching case which looks really smart.
"Best !. Amazing colour ,very good quality product !I highly recommend American tourister!"
"Quality product. Loads of storage space, sturdy,mobile . Looks great. Excellent price on Amazon"
Perfect cabin Bag. Very nice trolley bag.. perfect size and awesome quality
"Pretty, distinctive colour. Sturdy, still looks like new after one year of use.Wheels do feel a bit cheap/flimsy yet they stay where they should be."
"Easy to spot on the carousel. Great colour and really sturdy, well-constructed, and secure-feeling suitcase. The various pockets and things inside were really useful - even if it took me a while to figure out how I wanted to divide my stuff up :). This case was really easy to move around the airport and carpark, and the lock was easy to set (note there were no instructions in the information that came with the case but American Tourister have an explanation on their website and there's also a youtube video that walks you through it). The case held up to a UK->USA trip with a connection - only some very minor cosmetic scuffing and no cracks at all.Would definitely look at this brand again for other sizes."
Amazing cabin size. Managed to get 5 day holiday clothes in!
Backup luggage. Bought this luggage at arrival destination as the other luggage broke. Plenty of space especially at the end of my trip I had purchase more clothing to be packed. Lightweight to manoeuvre around. Happy with my purchase for the price I paid.
"Lots of room. Can’t comment on travelling, haven’t gone yet. However delivery came next day, I got to track the whole thing. Easy to get upstairs. Came with a bag to keep it protected and also covers on. Lovely in black, got the LARGE size which is 75CM so standard size for large. Easy to create pin. Absolutely love it; hope it’s good for travelling!"
excellent product. great suitcase. light but roomy. easy to move around
"A must-have for your holidays!. I've got two touristers,  and this middle sized one us great for a short holiday. Lightweight and very spacious, I think these are great!"
"Great medium sized case. Loads of room, robust and sturdy. Easy to wheel around. Handle has height adjustment that is perfect for shorter people. Arrived really quickly and came with a dust bag too!"
Great cases. Great cases perfect sized and robust but light weight
Lightweight. Great to move about & lightweight.
The One. That's what I was looking for.
Lovely. Lovely suitcase
"Suitcase. Superfast delivery, great product, ordering again"
"great product. excellent , lightweight and strong. Very stylish too"
Handle issues. I am a frequent traveller but used this case so far only twice. My big issue is that the handle constantly moves up and down when rather than remaining extended ... this might become a warranty issue
"Really Nice. For a carry on, this has great space and looks really nice very pleased I got them"
"Great value!. Great suitcase - as described. Came in it’s branded packaging .Many thanks for speedy , great value, service."
brilliant and lightweight. super light and perfect size!
"Dodgy case. Arrived today for a trip I'm making tomorrow, only the TSA lock reset button is stuck rendering the case usless."
best hand luggage I've ever had. It 's great in all aspects! Resistant and well designed and...easily distinguishable :)
"Fit for purpose. It meets all of our requirements, arrived very well packaged and provides good value."
As good as samsonite!. Absolutely love these suit cases ! They are so unique and resilient. They might be slightly more expensive but well worth the money. The whole mechanics of mobility is second to none.
Strong and Sturdy.. Strong and is easy to manoeuvre. Good purchase. Nice colour too.
Strong. Very strong
"satisfy. great value, looks better in hand"
Good. Very good hope it lasts
"Case Closed. We have had American Tourister cases for the last 5 years & they have served us well.  Unfortunately, airplane travel has started to take its toll & although the cases have stood up well to the rigours of baggage handling they are beginning to look a bit shabby - you would too if you'd been thrown about as much by a 20 stone baggage handler @ Luton!Time for new & we purchased 2 x 75 cm this time.  Our usual allowance is 20 kg per person & the 91 Litre case is a perfect match for that allowance.Our first trip with new cases is next week & hopefully we will get the same reliability as we did with the old ones."
Good buy. Love it exactly the same standard as samsonite
"Great cabin bag!. This is a great little cabin bag! I purchased the Deep Turquoise colour and it is a lot darker than the picture. The picture shows it as almost a green colour but I much prefer the actual colour. I would say it is a teal colour, hence why I have only given it 4 stars as it isn't the same colour shown."
"Bad experience. Got a differs colour to what I ordered and too much fuss to return it back.Suitcase is good quality wise, but size dis not seem as big as it was specified."
Arrived well ahead of time. Suitcase arrived a week before I expected which was fabulous and a pleasant surprise. I really love the colour and it's so light! Thank you!
"Great case for the money. Bought for a friend. Lightweight, sturdy. Compartments good. Great for a holiday on the move where you don’t unpack. Best case ever!"
Robust. Used once and so far works out for storage and robust handling. I believe its worth the cost.
"Parcel force delivery. 5 stars for the luggage, lightweight and seems durable. However the delivery with Parcel force was awful. Had to take the product myself all the way from the depot just in case I miss another delivery which I'm not even made aware of. I was in the house the whole time, nobody came up to my floor and rang the doorbell and not even a delivery card was left for me. I was desperate to have this product because I was moving out."
Fast Delivery. Excellent purchase. Very pleased with cases. Really quick delivery. Thank you!
"Durable, easy to use, conforms to fussy cabin luggage requirements. Great quality at quite reasonable price. Conforms easily to all fussy cabin bag rules of easyJet and Ryanair plus many more airlines. Only weighs 2.5kg. Durable, easy to roll on 4 or 2 wheels. We all have one in bright, easy-to-spot colours in my family. Thoroughly recommended."
"Perfect. Love it, such a pretty colour!"
great case. just the job for a couple of weeks away
"Solid and well made travelling suitcase. I have already been using the suitcase quite a bit and it has performed quite well. I move on a weekly basis and there is a fair amount of walking between the station and the hotel not to speak about using public transport in between. The wheels look quite well considering the amount of going around they have already taken and also the main body looks okay. Overtime it's going to show more and more wear and tear but as of right now the suitcase is taking the process very well and like it is going to last for a good while.The capacity is also very good. They say it's a 1 week suitcase, my guess is that you can make it up to two weeks  depending on the season. I managed to package a week and a half the first time without any issues and there were toiletries, hair dryer, an electric toothbrush along with walking boots inside in winter. So I'd say it's a generous 1 week capacity. I was able to see the capacity for the 2 weeks one and in my opinion it would have been more than 2 weeks.The hard case for the suitcase looks also very nice. The contents are not damaged inside and it protects them quite well. That said I have not used the suitcase on airports as the travelling I do is mostly by train, so I cannot say how it will deal with the kind of treatment suitcases get in there. As of now the exterior looks good and the contents inside have not been damaged.Overall very pleased with the product, it's performing very nicely and it's exactly what I was looking for."
Bon Voyage!. I like it.
Amazing for airport use. The size is perfect for two weeks away with enough space to pick some things up on a trip.I also found it incredibly easy to maneuver with smooth wheels allowing me to get around airports easily.
Sturdy case. Looks sturdy and just the size I was looking for. I already have a ( larger) American Tourister case which has survived a lot of travel.Not yet used this one  but will be put to the test soon.It’s a nice bright red so should be easy to spot on the luggage carousel.
"Very dissatisfied with American Tourister case. I purchased two of these American Tourister - Bon Air - Spinner 75cm cases in 2015. After using one for only 8 short haul holidays (16 flights) both handles snapped when l lifted the packed case. This was not due to overpacking, there was still ample room inside and nothing heavy, just clothes etc. for a holiday in the sun. I consider this totally unacceptable. The other matching case has survived 10 short haul holidays so l am not confident about it's future durability.I would certainly not recommend this case as l consider it unfit for purpose and with only a two year warranty l am left with n expensive piece of junk plastic to dispose of!"
Lightweight and easy to wheel. Love the colourLove the pad lock on the side
Very good.. I’ve used this for a few trips now and I really like it. Wheels are solid and general construction is very good. I went for the blue one.
"Suitcase. Good case, very light and easy to manoeuvreExpensive but best price on Amazon"
"Weak product. The very first time I used this on a flight, the zip opened at a weak spot and now the case is unusable as the zip does not stay closed."
Four wheeled case. Bought the case for a holiday later in the year.  It looks very nice and is light weight.
Brilliant. Superb cabin luggage at an amazing price.  Well made and attractive.
"Easy to spot lightweight suitcase. The size, colour and how light it is"
"Great. Bought the largest Bon Air suitcase a couple of years ago and love it so much I decided to get the cabin version, too. Haven't tried it yet but if the quality and durability of my large case is anything to go by, this is a great case."
"Great Value. Great suitcase. Strong, reliable and hard wearing."
So far so good. I've used this luggage on a few of occasions now and still looks like a solid product. Nice colour and spacious.
Mixed opinion. Like light weight and strength of container. Like locking system.Do NOT like extending handle. It is poor quality and will not sustain frequent use.
Faulty. The handle was faulty and I had to return it. The seller never refunded .
"MyChoice customer service is bad. This suitcase was purchased for my grandson to take to New Zealand, when it was opened it was noticed that some of the meshing was damaged. I contacted My choice who have told me to use the case and then take the problem up with Samsonite on return. So that will mean its travelled 22,000 by mid January. Why should I go direct to Samsonite surely it should be My choice who sort this out. They have passed the buck and do not deserve a rating of any sort. Shame as I actually liked the case."
Good buy. Smart and reliable
A robust attractive case. Love it
"Super light and quite rugged - NZ & Aus return with only a few scratches.. Full-sized zipped divider creates separate compartment in top half of case, plus plenty of pockets to make odds and ends easy to retrieve. Only problem was awkwardness of setting combination lock - bought two cases and broke the lock on first one when trying to set the combination: supposed to insert pencil tip or similar to disengage mechanism and when it didn't seem to work I pushed too hard and it jammed. Managed to get it right on the second case, but there is no repair centre in UK so the first case is no use for flying now. Annoying!"
Great luggage. Awesome luggage and it survived 15 days off and on a coach. Though it does mark easily which is a shame
Dies what it says!. Fantastic little suitcase.. Travel alot for work and it great! <U+0001F44D>
..... Excellent product. As described and prompt delivery.
Great Buy. Lovely product well made. Good size travels well it's only a pitty the airlines throw it around and after 1 short haul trip already looks a bit worn.Would buy again.
I already own 4 large American Tourister. Needed a .... I already own 4 large American Tourister.Needed a cabin lugguage.Same quality and reliable.You will not regret it
"Wheel broke after one trip. This looked like a great suitcase, but after one trip away one wheel has broken and the case will no longer roll, making it very inconvenient. I would not buy this again, and recommend choosing a different brand."
"Durable. My suitcase took a real battering on its way home from India, but survived intact. A durable case that survives the heavy knocks."
One flight so far. one flight so far but love it. It's a good size for up to 23 kg. I will get scratched easily so if you want to keep it shiny than you better cover it before flight
"Love the colour. Love the colour (red) , very light weight, good size , good value for the money"
Best case ever. So lightweight and easy to move.  Great colour. Inside easy to pack in two halves. Best case ever
Perfect for 2 day trip or habd luggage. Very slick and compact
Durabale. Amazing light weight solid suit case smart and easy to wheel around a busy airport
Used every other week. Amazing quality with good price. Used frequently for last 4month. No any issues so far
"Lightweight. Bought for my son who was travelling europe. Very nice case, lightweight, but costly. He wanted this for his birthday."
Super suitcases. Super suitcases! Initially I thought they looked a bit small but they fit loads in them. They’ve already been on one holiday and were perfect. Very pleased with them. They have a flexible hard outer which is very durable.Only slight comment is the inside compartment zips aren’t 2 way which is useful when you’re trying to get last little bits in.
"excellent suitcase. I used the suitcase for the first time for a long trip to Indochina which included several flight changes and many airport handlers. I am delighted with my purchase, despite the scratches that are inevitable when travelling so much. It is light, strong and easy to manoeuvre. I am going to buy another one. One size down for shorter trips."
"Big, sturdy and easy to wheel around. Used recently for a long multi-journey trip to the US and previously to Italy. Has a TSA approved lock which is essential if you've previously had the TSA destroy your luggage. They opened this one on my latest journey, but at least they didn't break it this time."
"Buy it. This suitcase is wonderful. I love the colour, really practical. Loads of room. Very light and easy to move"
"both handels broken. Bought 2 of these cases 3 years ago both used for 9 European round trip flights. Both badly scratched I can live with this as I like the design but on last trip one case came back with both handle's broken , other buyers have reported same problem. I would not buy from this manufacturer again. Also I now notice they only have 2 year warranty."
Great buy. I am traveling tomorrow so fingers crossed
Luggage. Excellent as described
Great suitcase does what it says. Light weight easy to manuvere
Great little suitcase. Wonderful suitcase. Fits a lot in and is so smooth to wheel around! I am very happy with it. The colour gets a lot of attention too.
"Compact, neat case. Fab colour!. Neat suitcase, with internal divider and two pockets.  Handle which can be set at different heights. Glides along. Fab colour.Used it for 5 day trip away and got everything in I needed.  Looking to buy it for other family members. Definitely recommend it."
Great value for money. Great value for money
"An excellent suitcase.. On first examination, a light, strong suitcase. Well made with useful internal zipped pockets and retaining straps. Very smooth running on the four 360-degree wheels. Sturdy pull-out handle and clever fixed 3-digit lock for the closing zips. (Only one small reservation - some text would have clarified the minimal illustrations serving as instructions for the lock)."
"Very nice suitcase. I'vd received the cuitcase on time and it is very nice, the colour as nie as I would expected. Very light and ever so strong."
Robust and light. Was not convinced about hard shell but may be a convert. Good features and so far very robust. Nice course too.
Good. Nice colour and size
"Good product. This luggage is well-organized, light and useful with its 4 wheels. Good quality of product but a bit expensive."
"Great compartments. Easy manoeuvring, solid light and great lock!. Seems good quality, stylish and easy to handle. Good compartments, really handy! Really happy with it especially the lock"
Best suitcase I've ever owned. Great quality.  So easy to glide around the airport with.  Integral combination locking system works great. The inside zip pockets keep all those bits and pieces in place. would recommend.
"Fantastic luggage.. Absolute amazing luggage. Fits everything you might need, spins like a charm and I like the inner compartments."
"Very sturdy, lovely colour. Unfortunately, I had to return this suitcase only because I'd ordered the wrong size and realised later that an expanding suitcase was better for my needs.  Otherwise I'd have loved to keep this - it looked very durable; I've had great faith in American Tourister products which I've used for many years.  PS:  Magma Red is a gorgeous colour!  My replacement suitcase is also an American Tourister but has the extra zip to accommodate extra luggage.  I'd certainly recommend this Bon Air model to anyone who doesn't need the expanding facility"
"Love it!. Great, sturdy, colourful case on wheels, arrived promptly in excellent condition - we love it!"
FANTASTIC. great product
"Not really worth the price. It's very light weight, but doesn't feel like it would stand the test of time seams very flimsy. Not worth the price. And the large is not that large <U+0001F644>"
NICE.... This suitcase has been everywhere with me. Most of all its perfect for hand luggage... overall a good little suitcase...
"Very nice case. Lovely colour, not yet used but it’s well made & very sturdy. That good I have bought another"
"Lightweight and sturdy. Arrived promptly. Great case, lightweight easy to manouvre, plenty of room . Stylish looking"
"Good quality... Only used it once. Time will tell !It’s easy to spot among the other bags !The wheels are really smooth and quite.I’m happy with the price, hope to get many of holidays out of this suitcase !"
"Five Stars. Great suitcase! Light, easy to maneuver, keeps luggage protected and fixed TSA lock is a nice added bonus."
Large suitcase easy to pull along with roller wheels. Spacious suitcase (91l) and easy to manoeuvre. Love the style and colour (midnight blue).
Photo colour isn’t accurate but great case. Don’t believe the greeny colour here. It’s blue just like the other size model. Really great product but the colour of the picture is weird. The two cases will match
Five Stars. Very good
American tourist case. Nice light case holds plenty can't wait to put it to use
"bright colour and very sturdy. The lock is easy to set and there’s .... Fast delivery, bright colour and very sturdy. The lock is easy to set and there’s plenty of space on the inside. Lots of zipper compartments to separate your clothes. Super happy with it, highly recommend."
"Great!. Looks stylish and does the job, light and spacious."
A very nice looking case.. The case looked very nice. I haven't used it yet so cannot comment on its performance.
Amazing suitcase. I got two for myself and my .... Amazing suitcase. I got two for myself and my son and it was a pleasure to travel with this lovely case. Look stunning and elegant. Highly recommend to everyone<U+0001F917><U+0001F917>
"Excellent Case. I love it! The colour is great (lavender blue), slightly darker and bluer than expected. I have used it for one trip so far and it performed great. The wheels move really nicely and I have had no problems with the handle. It would have been nice to have a side carry handle, but this is just my personal preference. The plastic case has scuffled a little bit, but it is only minor, and as a result of rough handling when being loaded in and out the luggage compartment on the coach."
Five Stars. Great suitcase - perfect size for a short trip which is longer than a weekend getaway
Five Stars. Excellent :)
"Debs. Ordered this case last minute so was a bit rushed on sourcing one. Arrived next day as I have amazon prime and I am very happy with my choice. Good size, lightweight and easy to manoeuvre. Very pleased with my purchase"
"I love this case. I love this case! I was concerned that the wheels would be ripped off, but a few flights in and they are still there... Love that you can separate the top and bottom half of your case, and pack each side separately, and the pockets are really useful. It glides really well when being pushed on all 4 wheels, however I find that the little button on the top (that raised and lowers the handle) is slightly sensitive, so if I grip the handle too tight it drops down, which can be a bit annoying when you have your hands full. Otherwise, it's excellent!!"
"Really pleased with this case lovely colour. Really pleased with this case lovely colour, easy to pack and wheels along great. Still looked good after aeroplane flight."
Five Stars. Luggage bags are very good but inside the suitcase does the seller have to stamp the warranty card so the warranty to take place
Lock faulty. Lock jammed first time I used it
Great product. Great product! All as described and expected.
Five Stars. Lovely cabin luggage.
"Dent after first use otherwise good. Pros: colour, many pockets and straps, good multi directional wheel action, flexible plasticCons: suffered a dent on the bottom and up the back after first use, which would concern me more if something more delicate was in the case, That said the dent mostly pushed out leaving a visible dent on the bottom and doesn’t appear to have cracked. They could also do with a slightly larger size as smaller than my previous case"
"Good sturdy suitcase. Good sturdy suitcase, plenty of space and good sections of pockets. It's very light and easy to move around thanks to the 4 wheels. My only issue is how easily the nice sleek outside case can get scuffed if you have to lay it flat on a hard surface. Would buy this again if I needed a second one."
"It worth to be bought. So far, very happy!"
Five Stars. Excellent and great value
Four Stars. Pleased with my purchase
"Surprisingly sturdy case in an eye-catching colour. We were wary of buying a case like this as it's been a while since we've had a hard case, and needed to fit a smaller case into this before travelling long-haul (so that we would have a spare, 3rd case, to fill up with the things we knew we would be buying along the way during our road trip).  I shouldn't have worried - this case stood up to everything we put it through and more.  I agree with another reviewer who recommended filling it up well, because it can feel a little flimsy when you press down on it...but don't be fooled, it's probably stronger than it feels.  Loved this colour as well."
A good case. The case was delivered on time and was as described. Perfect for a week away. The case feels robust and the 4 wheels make for smooth transportation. A reasonable amount of space inside.
Two Stars. Not Suitable for Carrying as it does not have a side handel
"Five Stars. Very happy, excellent!!"
"Disappointed:(. It seemed like a very sturdy item, when I purchased it 3 years ago. I travel about twice a year abroad and the case is still pretty good (apart from a few scratches), but one of the handles got ripped. Seems impossible to get it fixed or replaced due to its structure:( Such a shame! Of course it's out of warranty...."
Great purchase. High quality bag which should see us through many holidays. Sizing is quite compact but spacious inside. The separate section for suit etc is also very useful.
Great cabin luggage for frequent travelers. Excellent cabin luggage. Durable and relatively light. High quality of materials. Recommended
Great quality. Great quality
Great suitcase!. Great suitcase. Good value and quality. Every one had this colour on holiday though... so opt for a different colour. I bought this colour as I thought it would stand out on the carousel. It did! Along with 4 others on the same flight (no exaggeration). Great suitcase nonetheless xx
One Star. The bag was damaged when delivered. Also the bag had a dent on it and scratches at several places. It did not look like a brand new bag at all.
Good quality for a decent price. It's really well made and definitely worth the price.
Suitcase. Hubby was happy with this item.
Five Stars. Worth every penny !
"Top notch. Really pleased with this robust, stylish large suitcase. It is so light therefore not taking up your coveted allowance. Easy to push with 360 degree turn. Will definitely be buying one to match."
"Lightweight, easy glide suitcase. I am delighted with my suitcase.  It has several different sized sections which allows me to separate different types of clothing etc.  I also love the four wheels as I no longer have to pull my case as it just glides by my side with very little pressure with my hand."
Lightweight and roomy. Survived its first trip abroad.  I'm amazed at how much I can pack in.  Very lightweight and easy to wheel around.  Love the colour - easy to spot on the luggage carousel.
Five Stars. Really good stuff.
Five Stars. Super light and I love the compartments to pack your stuff neatly.Love it!
"Too drawer. Different class, love it"
Four Stars. Great case !
"Perfect. Amazing suitcase!Delivered in two days. Lovely design, plenty of space, it' s big suitcase but so light! Worth every pence!"
"American Tourista cases!. A colleague recommended the American Tourista as a brand that was reliable, sturdy and as secure as most other top branded travel goods - all of my top requirements as I travel weekly with my job. The price is always a key part of any purchase too and this company did not fail to deliver in all aspects!! I will purchase another case in the future, cabin sized for shorter trips away!! They even come with their own dust bag for storing purposes!!"
"Great sitcase. Great suitcase, almost floats along on the wheels. A good price and quick delivery"
This case is the best case I have ever had it holds a great .... This case is the best case I have ever had it holds a great deal of luggage because it's so light when empty.it's easy to maneuver I  am really pleased with it would recommend it to anyone who travels.
One Star. I didn't get any keys ..
"I recommend it and even have people running after me to .... Solid luggage for travelling for a week either for holidays or for business, I recommend it and even have people running after me to ask me where I bought it."
"American Tourister case - very happy with the purchase. Completed my first couple of trips with the case and it's worked faultlessly. Easy to pack and securely close. Pushing along in the upright position on the 4 wheels across most surfaces in an airport. Well designed section in the lid behind the zip compartment to store the last few soft items so that it fills the remaining space after packing the main compartment. only issue was working out how to change the the combination from the default code as there was no instructions with the case, I had to google (there's a small button to push with the end of a pen on the side)."
Happy with it. Used it only once so far but we really liked it. It holds enough for 2 people for 10 days. It seems sturdy and rolls easily. In the train it didn't topple like our old suitcase. It won't stay nice and shiny though but I really don't care about that.
Great Samsonite manufactured case. Great Samsonite manufactured case....To be honest why pay for the Samsonite brand?This is just as good. And i have both. Clever interior pockets and a handy lock. Wheeland handles seem strong.People have mentioned they mark a bit. Yes they do but what do you expect going throughthe rigours of the baggage handling process! But really not that bad. Hope to get a good fewyears out of this. Maybe opt for the darker colours mine looks fine after 4 flights.
"The rest of the case was really good quality. Might consider buying again. Unfortunately the handle was faulty and I only noticed once at the airport for my first trip. In all fairness, I sent the case back as soon as I got back from travelling and got a refund straight away. The rest of the case was really good quality. Might consider buying again, but will check that it’s in good working order before I travel next time."
Sturdy and light. Great for a weekend or few days away and just the right size. Handle and wheels are solid.
The handle doesn't stay up as soon as you put .... The handle doesn't stay up as soon as you put a light pressure it goes back down. I have another luggage exactly the same and it doesn't have this problem so I believe it's just a defect. However I bought it a few weeks before my partner's birthday so couldn't return it.
"Reputation intact. I have waited to post a review on here until I'd used this case a few times. I have now trolled about the world a bit with it and I am pleased to report that, so far, it lives up to its reputation. The main reason I wanted to buy it in the first place was that US customs had broken into my previous case and busted the padlock (this is an action customs are entitled to do and they left me an official note to say so!). However, this also meant any future padlocks I used with the previous case would also be busted so I sought an alternative. This model has one of the approved-by-US-and-other-customs combination locks which they (and, apparently, only they) have a gadget to override if required, and the lock would remain not only undamaged but locked for the remainder of its journey. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on which way you look at it, this has not been put to the test as I don't believe my my luggage has been searched by customer since.Having said all that, the case has been thrown about a fair bit and stilll looks almost untarnished, I also like the zipped internal compartment, although would like the other half of the case with a similar zip. Plus I love the colour and have decided to co-ordinate my hand luggage as well :)"
"Five Stars. Very robust, and light weight for the size."
"Four Stars. Good quality, sturdy and spacious. Collapsing handle could be little more sturdy.. Overall satisfied with this luggage"
Five Stars. Like filling a cave . Easy to manoeuvre
Travel in Style. Absolutely love this suitcase and would strongly recommend. It is light weight and has interior straps and a mesh zipped top that keeps everything secure and neatly packed. It manoeuvres very easily and glides by your side.
Perfect product. Amazing! and with a good price!
"Highly recommended.. I've had mine since December. I work in Europe and I've traveled once a week every week for the last 3 months, it's been in or on planes, trains, vans and cars and traveled a good 10,000 miles in that time.It's been an excellent suitcase. Sure it's scratched and bashed up a little, but it shows no sign of giving up, the wheels are still firmly attached, the handle is still working well and the zip and lock are in A1 condition.If you travel abroad a few times a year, this suitcase will do you a very good turn indeed.*Edit*13 months on and it's looking pretty beat up, I'm still traveling weekly/bi-weekly depending on my time away and it's still going strong. Wheels are fine, handles are fine the telescopic handle is fine, I'm very happy."
Making so much noise in less than 3 weeks. Just bought the trolly and thought that the brand would be good but after 2 weeks of usage it started making sqeeky noise and it’s really annoying when everybody looks at you while you travel with this trolly which makes such a noise . I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone .
"Fantastic suitcase. Built well, TSA locks work excellently for added security when travelling, and looks fantastic. Most importantly it fits a great deal inside which is ideal, I'm really pleased."
Very good. Excellent quality. Value for money
Terrible product. Not sure if it was a one .... Terrible product. Not sure if it was a one off but the wheels didn't work very well and hence making the suitcase more of a 2 wheel rather than 4 wheel. Then the handle stopped being able to adjust after only a few months so its now in the bin.
Very pleased. just the right size for. Very pleased.just the right size for travelling
"Inexpensive, magnificent quality. Best cabin suitcase I’ve ever earned. Note - it’s manufactured by Smasonite...!"
Nice look. Good quality but the inside zip was missing don’t know why
Five Stars. Gorgeous and sturdy. So glad I bought it
"Awesome quality, indestructible. the most durable suitcase I've ever owned, I travel for a living, almost every week my suitcase it's subject of abuse by luggage handlers being thrown around constantly, after 3 years the rubber on the wheels went, so I took it off the all and I had it going for another year. I'm replacing it because I think it's just indestructible and I'm due to an upgrade after 4 years !Perfect size for me too, the M that its, fits all I need for my short trips, Tools, clothes, shoes, toiletries and sometimes parts I need for the job..Awesome quality, indestructible"
Five Stars. Really classy design with a good amount of internal space. Offers good protection on flights.
Five Stars. Superb case first class seller
Five Stars. Excellent product. Used recently and very pleased.
Rolls easily on 4 casters. Well made. Lid is fitted with  a zipable cover and elastic strapping so everything is held securely and won't fall out when you open it. Rolls easily on 4 casters. Fits into overhead lockers with the top/handel facing out.
Recommend. Quality product
"Great suitcase very functional and study.. Great suitcase, very sturdy has been used for two holidays and two flights so far and showing hardly any signs of wear and tear. Good size for all holiday stuff and very easy to manoeuvre and glides well on the wheels. Lock works well and saves having a separate padlock. Good colour and stands out well on the carousel! Overall I am very pleased with the new suitcase and hope to use it for many more holidays. Highly recommended."
Four Stars. great product.. strong and durable
"Nice suitcase. Ideal light weight suitcase which allowed me to travel with my dive gear as well as mine and my daughter's holiday clothing, without being over weight. The colour is nice and bold and was very easy to spot on the conveyor belt. Yes, it got a little scuffed over the course of 4 flights, but I thought that was only to be expected, and from a distance it's not noticeable. The inside pockets and two halves design (as opposed to a deeper case with a shallow lid) worked well, and the straps kept everything secure. I like that the zips can be clicked into the lock without actually locking it, so they open at the touch of a button and don't need to be broken if security need to get in."
"The design is very nice! However. The design is very nice! However, this luggage was broken during its first trip (thanks to the staff at the airport of course). A plastic corner was totally damaged. Thus, the quality is not satisfactory<U+200B> for me. There was a problem with the zipper as well."
"Otherwise great product. I also have the large. Too big for Virgin Atlantic, my fault, should have checked but. Otherwise great product. I also have the large ones"
"Great suitcase, only been on one holiday so far .... Great suitcase, only been on one holiday so far but it seems to be robust. It’s quite light and easy to carry and wheel around."
Aweful quality of wheels. Broke during 1st year. Gave positive review initially as bag performed quite well. However already after few trips I've noticed that one of the wheels shows high resistance. Closer inspection revealed that under weight the plastic holding the wheel axis gave in leading to the tilt and rubbing against the holder. Eventially after few more trips dragging this bag turned into fitness. Although bag is OK I have to buy new one as it is not longer suitable to carry the load. Do not buy this crap.
"Five Stars. Excellent service, I would definitely recommend"
"Air Bon American Tourister. The American Tourister range is a compact and efficient piece of luggage.It's sleek design and robust usage makes it my number one choice for traveling. Designed with the TSA Airport baggage handlers in mind, the Bon Air model comes complete with plenty of room and equally many pockets for your access."
"Not very strong, scratch and mark very easily - Expensive. I had high hope when replacing my old cases with some new lighter models before my trip to Dubai.Having researched the internet I purchased two Black medium tourister casesThe cases looked superb when delivered and we managed to get everything in them for our vacationUnfortunately on the first leg of our journey the cases were dented, scratched and looked like they had been in use for 10 years! On the return even worse..In summary the cases are not upto being thrown around conveyor belts etc and are of brittle quality really disappointing considering the high cost I would not recommend. Very disappointed"
Good buy.. Taken two trips with this and was an excellent investment. In great condition.
Five Stars. Perfect
"Good bag, not amazing, but solid enough. (Broke ater 16 months). Update: Lasted 16 months before the extensible handle broke. I trave a lot - that's maybe 60 flights. So it's not BAD - but it's not good.Original review below:Solid piece of luggage, nice run quiet wheels, got a bit scratched after a couple of months use (I travel a few times a month, it scuffs quite badly when being handled by baggage handlers). I'd likely buy it again. Fits well in overheads and moves well even on rough surfaces."
"Five Stars. Great looking case, very comfortable to push/pull and turns corners with ease."
"delicate but good. Wheels are very good. The colour is beautiful, but already after one return trip, the suitcase is scratched..."
Five Stars. Excellent product.
Light and easy to manoeuvre.. Good all rounder.
"Bigger than imagined - case scuffs easily. This is a perfect sized suitcase (Medium) for a week away. Handy 'dual' compartments and lightweight. I try to pack the suitcase evenly, I feel like it would be prone to damage if empty and under weight. The aesthetic of the suitcase was scuffed after one flight, not to be unexpected and does not affect functionality, but I find it hard to understand why you would create a suitcase that is easily marked. It would have been better to keep plain. Easy to manoeuvre over a number of surfaces, the lock is easy to set your own code and feels secure. All round a good suitcase that feels as if it should last, though looks wise could be improved."
"poor warranty.. On the third use the lock on this case jammed, my passport and toiletries were inside.  I had to get airport security to break the case open and then travel home with an open suitcase.  Worse still, there is no return option on Amazon, and the only option available with the manufacturer is for me to drive 40 miles to the nearest authorised dealer for them to asses the problem."
Five Stars. everything is perfect.  I recommend them.
Great bit of kit.. Robust and fits in with the cabin baggage dimensions for most airlines. Good build quality and the wheels work well.
"Great!. Looks good, nice size (perfect for hand luggage). I'm 5ft 4 and my boyfriend is 5ft11 and we both use it and the handle works for both heights."
"Good quality. Having purchased 2 American Tourister suitcases previously, and being very happy with them. I decided to purchase one for my daughter. These suitcases are robust and easy to move around. They come complete with 3 numeral built in lock. Although the suitcase has travelled around through various airports, it has withstood the bashing it has no doubt endured very well. The suitcase is very well made and I understand but had no reason to test that bumps can be pushed out."
"Five Stars. Great suitcase, so easy to use I managed to wheel 3 at the same time"
"smooth wheels and good looking. smaller cases fit inside the larger sizes .... strong, light weight, smooth wheels and good looking.smaller cases fit inside the larger sizes so three cases take up the space of one for easy storage"
Five Stars. Good.
"Five Stars. Perfect size and effortless glide, recommended!"
Four Stars. Good
Great product!!. Great case.
Airline friendly. Early days but seems fit for purpose.
"Peace of mind at a reasonable price. What can you say? It's a suitcase with four wheels and doesn't weight a lot. It moves easily, the build quality is good and it's robust. If you want peace of mind at a reasonable price then it's for you."
Good size with easy access and great rolling ability. Bought for a business trip. Good size with easy access and great rolling ability. Could be used for up to a weeks travel.
Long haul tested. So I just got back from a holiday/vacation in Mexico from the UK.Firstly this is made by Samsonite (A more budget friendly line)  so the quality is very good and the case itself is light. The handles and extension are all very sturdy.The wheels are very nice and smooth and overall the case is very well made with plenty of compartments to separate your things.Having only done one long haul trip so far I can guess that this case will last a long time. The only damage it sustained was some scuffs and a few minor scratches. Everything inside was perfectly protected.It was also delivered in a sturdy box with no chance of damage on arrival.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.
Five Stars. Such a great laguagge!
Five Stars. just what I wanted for the aeroplane insteadof lugging a back pack which strained my neck!
"Light, well made and a doddle to move around with. Great case. Light well made and a doddle to move around the airport with and easily managed a two week business tour in Asia. Probably buying a second one for longer / accompanied trips."
Four Stars. Good quality. Would love a side drawer for documents on the side.
"Great product. It's a great suitcase: good quality, nice design, light weight and the price is ok. Nothing to complain about it!"
"Four Stars. Great, lightweight suitcase.  Very roomy for its compact size."
Very nice and spacious suitcase. Perfect suitcase for a two week holiday. The shiny bit does get scratched but as expected when you take your suitcase on a plane
Five Stars. Love it - fits a lot for its size perfect for hand luggage
"My wife likes it so it must be good. I actually have one of these in black. I bought this one for my wife because she kept nicking mine.  The first thing you notice is how light this case is so it contributes very little to your baggage weight allowance. So far, I'm very pleased with it. It moves effortlessly on its wheels across smooth airport floors and also copes well when being dragged across rough car parks when trying to find your hire car.  The inner zipped compartments divide the space in two which is very handy."
Five Stars. Thank you so mich good quality arrived before expected.
"Excellent suitcase. Used and used and used.  Lovely case, durable, easy to push / move / glide.  Very pleased."
Transit damage. Went back_ huge dent in case and wheel bent at 45 degrees
DIRE QUALITY - ZIP & INSIDE POCKET BROKEN AFTER 1st attempt!. Very poor quality. Used it once and both the zip & inside pocket have broken! Shoddy workmanship indeedI'm hoping to get a full refund.
Five Stars. Parfait
Happy. More than happy with my purchase. The quality is good and the case rolls perfectly.
"A nice case but not robust. This is a light and good looking case but I have had it for less than four months, used it no more than 15 times and the handle has broken. A shame really as it was good while it lasted."
"Perfect. Perfect, very light"
Five Stars. I recommend it!
Five Stars. Really great cabin case - plenty of room - and fits well with the airline restrictions.
"Good. Good value, I like this luggage!"
Did not survive 1 trip!. We got this suitcase because the reviews seemed pretty positive and the brand was well known. I had to buy it as I was going to Hong Kong in the next few weeks. On my return I found that there was a big crack along the front of the suitcase. Was extremely unhappy as I thought it would at least survive one trip!I raised a complaint to BA as well as returned the item. Will need to reconsider other brands before buying another suitcase.Gave 2 stars as the overall suitcase was everything we was looking for
"I rest my case. Very good light weight case with wheels and handle, ideal for travelling."
"Great value.. A great little carry on case, does the job perfectly!"
"Nice form and good quality.. I like it, because this is'nt to big, but enough for a few days tour. Nice form and comfortable, with good quality."
"Nice and large and good case but seems to mark .... Nice and large and good case but seems to mark far too easily.  I have done 1 international  trip in South Africa over 2 weeks and the case looks well travelled already.  Size is great though,  let's hope it lasts"
Faulty zip. The zip didn't close the first time I tried it and it has not got any betterI have to be very careful when closing the zip or I have to force it backwards and start again
"it is usually suitable for weekends trips, but I .... it is usually suitable for weekends trips, but I take it for 5 days trip as well. it is light and the wheels are flexible. pleasant shopping!"
Four Stars. Came well packaged and I love it!
Four Stars. Pleased with purchase
Do it - it's the best thing for you.. Elegant and smooth. The other half loves it and enjoyed strutting his stuff with his new suitcase.The four wheels are easy to manoevre and push along - but less easy on rough surfaces!It is a slim suitcase so should work with the strictest of airlines but requires some strict packing. Probably not a good choice for a serial overpacker!Great colour - not so many people have these yet so you'll still be cool and able to spot it amongst all the black and red cases.
"light to use & easy to wheel. Very handy size, light to use & easy to wheel."
Five Stars. Exactly as expected and sturdy
... dropping down when case being wheeled which was very annoying. May have just been unlucky. Returned this item as handle kept dropping down when case being wheeled which was very annoying. May have just been unlucky.

"sturdy and lots of room. this is stong, sturdy and lots of room, very happy with this purchase"
Seems a very stable suitcase. This seems a very stable suitcase can't comment anymore than that as I have not used it yet
Four Stars. Nice quality I like it!
Great suitcase.. Strong and robust suitcase. Have used it a few times now for various short & long haul flights and a few coach tours. Holding up very well to the handling and hauling associated with such trips.Good value for money.
"Okay .... I really liked this when it arrived - looks sturdy & stylish.  However, after one trip it is really badly marked.  Thought it would have been a bit more durable for the price."
Good quality and stylish cabin case. Very sturdy cabin case with lots of pockets inside. Looks good too.
"excellent. The bag itself. I have just received this through the post after ordering it yesterday. So, my experience with Logistics is, once again, excellent.The bag itself: it is very nice, sturdy, and of great quality. The compartments inside are brilliant and the locking system is faultless. I will extend this review once I have used the bag properly, but so far, I give 5 stars."
OK but.... This is the Ryanair approved (so far as size goes) take on luggage.I found it to be lightweight but. Little flimsy.The case opens up into 2 and the contents a repstrained by straps on one side and a zipped compartment on the other. On its first use the sticking ripped on the zipped compartment side which was disappointing.The outside of the case scuffs and marks very easily.I guess you get what you pay for.
Five Stars. Very nice well made
"Five Stars. Excellent product, I am delighted!"
"Four Stars. Perfect size, and good quality build"
Luggage to have!. Received the luggage after a day of ordering it. it is classy yet stylish at the same time. Perfect size as hand carry for almost all airlines including RyanAir.
"Handle broke. A real shame. The case looks great, enough space, everything was great, until the handle broke on the third time of using. Bought a different type of case because of this."
A good suitcase. A good suitcase. I like the zip pockets which make it easier to separate items and its smart and compact.  The only downsides were that it scuffs easily and the handle stopped extending out fully during my first use of the suitcase (although I think this was due to possibly overfilling it as the handle was fine when the suitcase was emptied).
... it for my son and he is more than happy with it. I bought it for my son and he is more than happy with it.
Five Stars. As previously posted.
Five Stars. Smart and functional. Yet to be tested at airports.
Great cabin suitcase. Great business suitcase. Very pleased with it. Easy to manoeuvre and looks very professional.
"Recommended. Good solid lightweight suitcase, compartments are good and felt pretty sturdy. Holds plenty for a week away for someone who over packs. It has been on one trip so far and has scratched up pretty badly however it's to be expected from a suitcase with a polished finish, I'll be happy as long as it doesn't crack!Would recommend as long as you won't be upset when it doesn't look pretty and new anymore."
Five Stars. So easy to use nice and light
Five Stars. nice!
"perfect!. Solid, stylish, perfect!"

Five Stars. Great product.
good buy. very light and spacious bag in lovely color
"Great product, sturdy. Great product, sturdy, business like and the 4 wheels make it a doddle to maneovre around an airport. Combine with the american tourister toulouse shoulder bag which fits nicely on top as hand luggage to then detach once the suitcase is checked in."
Nice compact and sturdy bag- excellent price. Nice compact and sturdy bag- excellent price.  Comply with European airline carry-on bag size restrictions.  Only complaint is that the smooth portion of the bag front becomes noticeably scratched and marred.
"Stylish and functional. Really happy with this product. Robust , smart and functional. It wheels around perfectly and has a great locking system.. I've used it on an easy jet flight and it's the optimum size to qualify for ""hand luggage"" and it has ample size for a long weekend away."

"Suitcase. Bought this some months ago but waited until after holiday to review.Quite simply the best suitcase I've ever used. Loads of space inside. Sturdy, yet light as they come. No problems with the wheels. And the security lock is a very nice bonus - easy to set and totally secure."
Four Stars. Great .
Five Stars. Excellent all round.
Delivered quickly and safely good looking case. Not used yet but good looking light lots of useful divisions delivered quickly second one I have bought other in different size.
Don't choose black. The quality is good but I'd suggest going for a different colour as it does look quite dull and almost cheap (but is good quality I insist).
"Five Stars. Brilliant, just as ordered"
"Not bad, but has vulnerable spots.. Great that one half of the opened case is zipped in its own enclosure. This combined with the hard case design means that clothes are in the same condition when unpacking as when packed. I've only completed one trip to the U.S with it thus far. I've noticed it does pick up dirt very easily, but it's also easily wiped away. It's a mostly curved case but the only two small corners on the back near the handle were the same locations that got noticeably scuffed, so likely a vulnerable area. I'll have to remember to duck tape those corners before my next trip to help avoid further damage. However I did make the decision to nonetheless buy this case despite knowing its not made of hardest case material generally available which is polycarbonate, so I I'm not really surprised."
Five Stars. Good quality suitcase.
Four Stars. The hand luggage is really good~
"Great price and quick delivery from amazon. Great price and quick delivery from amazon. Very light but strong suitcase, already own a bigger size of the same suitcase. Highly recommended."
The product is quite good and stylish. The product is quite good and stylish. Its a great fit between a very small and medium one. you can easily carry it for 2-3 days travel.
"Looks good.... Everything looks good, particularly the locking system, but the proof will only be evident when it has been thrown about by baggage handlers around the globe!"
"Sturdy and spacious. Item arrived as scheduled, in good condition, undamaged.  This was bought as a gift and the recipient is very happy with it.  It is more spacious than it looks and enough for a week's holiday in warm weather."
Looks good and great value for money. Nicely made and good looking suitcase from American Tourister (aka Samsonite). Decent size case that should fullfill my needs. Haven't used it yet but judging by the quality of the materials it should hopefully stand the test of time. The TSA combination lock is a great idea especially for travel to the US. All in all I'm pleased with my purchase.
American Tourister suitcase. Love this suitcase just come back from Bali and managed to pack so much in this case for 10 day vacation.Would recommend to my friends. The case arrived on time.
Nice and Neat. Love this case ordering 2 more
Four Stars. good quality delivered when it said it would be no complaints.
"Not as good as expected.. Exterior scratches really easy. One trip to Scotland and is not looking good anymore. Interior lining has tore a bit... Previous American Tourister luggage really sturdy and well made, but not this one."
Very good. Already been on holidays with it. Very good bay
"Great Lightweight Luggage = Perfect for short business trips. Really light. Small/slim, but still takes a lot of stuff. Easily fits into the overhead on an aircraft. Used it on a recent 3 day trip and it was fine. Great buy!"
Weathered two long haul flights and still looks good. Good amount of storage and a sturdy suitcase. Weathered two long haul flights and still looks good. Good amount of storage and a sturdy suitcase. It's an expensive purchase but one I don't think I will need to make again for a few years. Plus I love the colour!
Excellent - I purchased three. Excellent value for money. Great material as can just push dents out again. Highly recommend.
Three Stars. Gets scratched quite easily
Five Stars. excellent suitcases. we are just packing them to go on holiday to Portugal. Good locking system on them.
Five Stars. Great for short haul flights!
Five Stars. Very good nice size and light
"good quality item. bought this for my daughter, it looks sturdy and well made but also very light, the four wheels are a bonus, very maneuverable, there is a zipped compartment in the lid which you could use to separate your 'dirties' from clean clothes, she was very pleased with it"
"Although, the body of the suitcase is very flexible .... Although, the body of the suitcase is very flexible yet it's very strong suitcase. I traveled on long-haul flights with a ,lot of connecting flights but this suitcase gave me no problem until now. It's a must buy if you are looking for quality product !!!"
Five Stars. Everything went just perfect. And the suitcase is amazing.
"Great Case. Brilliant quality case. Easy to manoeuvre. Looks substantial. Like the zip compartments inside, prevents clothes, items moving when opened. Really pleased."
Five Stars. Good product
"Nearly a 5* travelling companion.. The case weighs a little over 4kg which is astounding for such a large case. The handle and plastic shell feel sturdy however I have my worries at the protruding wheels which may fall foul of clumsy baggage handlers. The other downside is the inability to add my own lock to the zips, and while the TSA approved combination lock is suffice I would always like the additional security of adding my own lock to the case too."
Five Stars. Excellent
Five Stars. good product
"Light robust, has plenty of handy pockets and has .... Light robust, has plenty of handy pockets and has peace of mind knowing it's Ryanair approved. I've bought two."
Four Stars. Haven't tested it yet but seems sturdy with good internal straps and pockets
Five Stars. Great product
"Good value and surprisingly roomy. Good value, sturdy and secure. Has so far survived 3 flights."
I State My Case.. Others have said that these are identical to Samsonite's and the cases that Ryanair sell. That aside they look great and feel nice and light. A quality item at a good price. I'm afraid no one else is borrowing these :) .
Just the job!. This is an excellent case - well designed and robust.  I chose the dark blue as it is an elegant colour yet easy to pick out on the airport carousel.
Five Stars. Ok

Excellent quality and I was amazed that it arrived on .... Excellent quality and I was amazed that it arrived on 23rd December and not 2nd January as originally estimated.  I was delighted as I wanted to use it on a holiday to Spain for New Year.  It is superbly designed and I can thoroughly recommend both the suitcase and the vendor.
"Five Stars. Good bag. Strong, sturdy. Like the pockets. Handle is strong and rolls nicely"
"I was looking for a Samsonite suitcase of similar size .... I was looking for a Samsonite suitcase of similar size and build, and it turns out that American Tourister is a sub-brand of Samsonite, but less than half the price!Took this suitcase to Turkey for a travelling holiday and it coped well, the wheels are very smooth so the case will roll for ever if you let it, and the handle is strong enough for you to whizz the full case around without it buckling under the weight."
Five Stars. looooooooove it
"Very good cases. We bought these for a month long tour of America which included 2 long haul and 5 internal flights. I am pleased to say they are still working perfectly, the only damage being cosmetic (scratches and scuffs - the cases really took a battering from the looks of it). The inside is very well laid out which made packing and unpacking very easy.The cases are very light and easy to maneuver around and the combination lock is a nice touch as you can lock away passports and laptops etc and not have to worry about light fingered maids!So to summarize - a strong, practical, light and durable case."
Good suitcase. Very pleased. Really light. Good size. Like the idea of the lock. Quick delivery!
"Four Stars. Nice item, scratches easily though"
Five Stars. Great piece of luggage at a nice price.

Five Stars. An excellent item.  You can't beat Samsonite
"Solid, Quality, stylish & Fast delivery. Quick delivery within 24hrs - Nicely packaged with all the authentic tags and product warrantees including an official Ryanair cabin luggage approval tag. The case is of solid construction and quality build and looks very stylish and not too shiny and cheap looking. I have not taken it for a spin yet but I doubt there will be any problems. I am happy with this buy."
"Excellent fast delivery. Stylish case exactly as described, Excellent fast delivery."
Four Stars. A very good sized suitcase. Lightweight and easy to pull along.
